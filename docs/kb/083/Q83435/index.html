SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article can be found in the SYSINI.WRI file in the
Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1. The SYSINI.WRI file can be viewed in Microsoft Windows Write. Write
is an application contained in the Windows Accessories Group.

The [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains information specific to
running Windows in 386-enhanced mode, including information used for
virtual-memory page swapping.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [386Enh] section can contain the following settings:
===============================================================================

32BitDiskAccess=&lt;boolean&gt;
Default:  Off if your hard disk is capable of supporting 32-
         bit disk access. Otherwise, this setting is not
         present in the SYSTEM.INI file.
Purpose:  Turns 32-bit disk access on or off.
To change:  Choose the 386 Enhanced icon in the Control
           Panel window. If this setting is not present in
           the SYSTEM.INI file, the 32-bit Disk Access
           check box will not appear in the Control Panel
           Virtual Memory dialog box.

===============================================================================

A20EnableCount=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  The value computed by the Win386 loader.
Purpose:  Specifies the initial A20 enable count. (For more
         information about the A20 enable count, see your
         Extended Memory specification).
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting.)

===============================================================================

AllVMsExclusive=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  False
Purpose:  If enabled, this setting forces all applications
         to run in exclusive full-screen mode, overriding
         all contrary settings in the applications' program
         information files (PIFs). Enabling this setting
         might prolong the length of the Windows session
         when you are running network and memory-resident
         software that is incompatible with Windows.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

AltKeyDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .005
Purpose:  Specifies how much time Windows waits to process a
         keyboard interrupt after it processes an ALT
         interrupt.  Some applications expect a slower
         processing rate than Windows in 386 enhanced mode
         normally uses. Increase this value if such an
         application has trouble handling the ALT key.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

AltPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .025
Purpose:  Specifies how much time Windows waits before
         pasting any characters after the ALT key has been
         released. Some applications may require more time
         for recognition of the ALT keystroke.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

AllEMSLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  False
Purpose:  If enabled, this setting locks the contents of
         expanded memory used by all Windows and non-
         Windows applications into memory (instead of
         swapping it to disk) and overrides the non-
         Windows application PIF settings for EMS Memory
         Locked. Set this value to True if you are using a
         disk cache program that uses expanded memory.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

AllXMSLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  False
Purpose:  If enabled, this setting locks the contents of the
         extended memory used by all Windows and non-
         Windows applications into memory  (instead of
         swapping it to disk), and overrides non-Windows
         application PIF settings for XMS Memory Locked.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

AutoRestoreScreen=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True
Purpose:  Specifies whether the display for non-Windows
         applications should be restored by Windows or the
         applications themselves when they become active.
         If enabled, Windows saves the display information
         for a non-Windows application in memory when you
         switch away from the application. When you switch
         back to the application, Windows uses this
         information to restore the screen. If disabled,
         the application must restore its own display by
         repainting the screen. This requires less memory,
         but can slow down performance since Windows can
         usually restore the screen faster.

Note:  This setting only applies to VGA displays and affects
      only applications that notify Windows that they can
      update their own screen automatically when Windows
      initiates a display update call.

To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

BkGndNotifyAtPFault=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True for VGA displays; False for 8514 displays.
Purpose:  Specifies when a notification should be sent to a
         non-Windows application or to Windows to prevent
         the application from attempting to access the
         display (which might corrupt the display of a
         different application). This notification can be
         sent while switching to a different application or
         when attempting to access the actual display. If
         disabled, Windows sends a notification when
         switching between applications. Disable this
         setting if you are using a display that has
         special hardware, (for example, 8514 and TIGA). If
         you are using a VGA display, enabling this setting
         should work in most cases.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

CGA40WOA.FON=&lt;filename&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed-pitch display
         font used for non-Windows applications with a
         display of 40 columns and 25 or fewer lines.
To change:  Quit Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS
           prompt. Change the Codepage or Display
           setting.

===============================================================================

CGA80WOA.FON=&lt;filename&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed-pitch display
         font used for non-Windows applications with a
         display of 80 columns and 25 or fewer lines.
To change:  Quit Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS
           prompt. to change the Codepage or Display
           setting.

===============================================================================

CGANoSnow=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  No
Purpose:  If enabled, causes Windows to do special handling
         to avoid snow appearing on an IBM CGA display
         device.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COM1AutoAssign=&lt;number-or-seconds&gt;
COM2AutoAssign=&lt;number-or-seconds&gt;
COM3AutoAssign=&lt;number-or-seconds&gt;
COM4AutoAssign=&lt;number-or-seconds&gt;
Default:  2
Purpose:  Indicates the contention detection values for each
         connected serial port. These values are used by
         Windows to determine how to arbitrate requests for
         the use of a device by more than one application,
         at least one of which is a non-Windows
         application. If the value is -1, Windows will
         display a warning message that asks you which
         application should be given control of the port.
         If the value is zero, any application can use the
         device at any time. If the value is a positive
         integer less than 1,000, this value represents the
         number of seconds after an application stops using
         the device before another application can use the
         same device.
To change:  Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control
           Panel window.

===============================================================================

COM1Base=&lt;address&gt;
COM2Base=&lt;address&gt;
COM3Base=&lt;address&gt;
COM4Base=&lt;address&gt;
Default:  COM3Base=3E8h and the port address values located
         in the BIOS data area for COM1, COM2, anc COM4.
Purpose:  Specifies the base (first) port for the serial
         port adapter you are using. Check you hardware
         documentation for the appropriate value.

Note:  Windows uses these values for both standard and 386
      enhanced mode.
To change:  Use the Advanced Settings dialog box for the
           Ports option in Control Panel.

===============================================================================

COMBoostTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:  2
Purpose:  Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to
         allow a virtual machine to process a COM
         interrupt. If a communications application is
         losing keyboard characters on the display, you can
         try increasing this value.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COM1Buffer=&lt;number&gt;
COM2Buffer=&lt;number&gt;
COM3Buffer=&lt;number&gt;
COM4Buffer=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  128
Purpose:  Specifies the number of characters that the device
         on the corresponding serial port will place in the
         buffer. Before changing one of these settings, see
         the corresponding COMxProtocol setting to make
         sure that it has the proper value. Buffering may
         slow down communications on a port, but might be
         necessary to prevent some communications
         applications from losing characters at high baud
         rates. The size of the buffer required will depend
         on the speed of the machine and the application's
         needs.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COMMdrv30=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  False
Purpose:  If enabled, indicates that the Virtual COM Driver
         (VCD) uses its own copy of the serial communica-
         tions driver's interrupt handler. This improves
         performance of your COM ports. Enable this setting
         if you are using a Windows 3.0 serial communica-
         tions driver. Disable this setting if you are
         using the standard Windows 3.1 serial communica-
         tions driver.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COM1FIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
COM2FIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
COM3FIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
COM4FIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True
Purpose:  Specifies whether the FIFO buffer of a COM port's
         16550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
         (UART) should be enabled (true) or disabled
         (false). If a serial port does not have a 16550
         UART, this setting is ignored.

Note:  These values are used by Windows for both standard
      and enhanced modes.

To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COM1Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM2Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM3Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM4Irq=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  COM1Irq=4; COM2Irq=3; COM3Irq=4; COM4Irq=3 for ISA
         and EISA machines. COM1Irq=4; COM2Irq=3;
         COM3Irq=3; COM4Irq=3 for MCA machines
Purpose:  Specifies which interrupt line is being used by
         the device on the corresponding serial port. Check
         your hardware documentation for the appropriate
         value. If there is a hardware conflict between
         ports, set this value to -1 to disable input for a
         COM port.

Note:  Windows uses these values for both standard and 386
      enhanced mode.

To change:  Use the Advanced Settings dialog box for the
           Ports option in Control Panel.

===============================================================================

COMIrqSharing=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True for Micro Channel (TM) and EISA machines;
         False for all other machines
Purpose:  Specifies whether COM interrupt lines are sharable
         between multiple serial ports or with other
         devices. Enable this setting if your machine uses
         the same interrupt for COM3 or COM4 as it does for
         COM1 or COM2.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

COM1Protocol=&lt;XOFF-or-blank&gt;
COM2Protocol=&lt;XOFF-or-blank&gt;
COM3Protocol=&lt;XOFF-or-blank&gt;
COM4Protocol=&lt;XOFF-or-blank&gt;
Default:  (Default is no entry, which is the same as any
         entry other than XOFF)
Purpose:  Specifies whether Windows in 386 enhanced mode
         should stop simulating characters into a virtual
         machine after the virtual machine sends an XOFF
         character. Set the value for a port to XOFF if a
         communications application using that port is
         losing characters while doing text transfers at
         high baud rates. Windows will resume simulating
         characters when the virtual machine sends another
         character after the XOFF character. Leave this
         setting disabled if the application is doing
         binary data transfers; enabling this switch might
         suspend binary transmissions. Windows will not
         check for XOFF characters if this setting is blank
         or set to anything other than XOFF. If the
         application continues to lose characters after
         this setting is properly set, try increasing the
         corresponding COMxBuffer value.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

Device=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt;
Default:  None (Setup assigns appropriate values based on
         your system configuration.)
Purpose:  Specifies which virtual devices are used with
         Windows in 386 enhanced mode. This value can
         appear in two ways: either the name of a specific
         virtual device file, or an asterisk (*) followed
         immediately by the device name. The latter case
         refers to a virtual device that is in the
         WIN386.EXE file. Filenames usually include the
         .386 extension. Multiple device lines are required
         to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

Display=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt; (See "Device=", above)
Default:  None (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
         your system configuration.)
Purpose:  Specifies the display device that is being used
         with Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window.

===============================================================================

DMABufferIn1MB=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  No
Purpose:  If enabled, Indicates that the direct memory
         access (DMA) buffer memory should be in the first
         1MB of memory (above 640K, if possible) in order
         to be compatible with 8-bit bus master cards.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

DMABufferSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default:  16
Purpose:  Specifies the amount of memory (in kilobytes) to
         be reserved for the direct memory access buffer
         (DMA). This memory will be allocated above 640K,
         if possible. Windows in 386 enhanced mode will
         default to a DMA buffer size that will handle disk
         access.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

DOSPromptExitInstruc=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  Yes
Purpose:  If enabled, when you start the MS-DOS prompt a
         message box appears, with instructions on how to
         exit and switch away from the MS-DOS prompt.
         Disable this setting if you do not want to see the
         message.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

DualDisplay=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  See "Purpose."
Purpose:  Normally, when running in 386 enhanced mode, the
         memory between B000:0000 and B7FF:000F is used by
         the general system unless a secondary display is
         detected. Enable this setting if you are using a
         VGA-based color display and want EMM386.EXE to
         include this address space as an upper memory
         block (UMB). In addition to enabling this setting,
         you must include the i= option in the
         device=EMM386.EXE command line in your CONFIG.SYS
         file as follows:

                               device=EMM386.EXE i=B000-B7FF

         If this setting is disabled, the address range is
         available on EGA systems, but not on VGA systems,
         because the VGA display device supports monochrome
         modes, which use this address space.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EBIOS=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt; (See "Device=", above)
Default:  None (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
         your system configuration.)
Purpose:  Specifies the extended BIOS device that is being
         used with Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EGA40WOA.FON=&lt;filename&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed-pitch display
         font used for non-Windows applications with a
         display of 40 columns and more than 25 lines.
To change:  Quit Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS
           prompt. Change the Codepage or Display setting.

===============================================================================

EGA80WOA.FON=&lt;filename&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed-pitch display
         font used for non-Windows applications with a
         display of 80 columns and more than 25 lines.
To change:  Quit Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS
           prompt. Change the Codepage or Display setting.

===============================================================================

EISADMA=&lt;Boolean&gt; or &lt;channel&gt;,&lt;size&gt;
Default:  0,8; 1,8; 2,8; 3,8; 5,16w; 6,16w; 7,16w (Each pair
         goes with its own EISADMA setting.)
Purpose:  Specifies the mode of operation of an extended DMA
         channel for Extended Industry Standard
         Architecture (EISA) machines only. This setting's
         value can take one of two forms. If you disable
         this setting, Windows will treat the machine as
         non-EISA, therefore avoiding all EISA-related
         logic. You can try disabling this switch if you
         cannot run Windows in 386 enhanced mode on your
         EISA machine. If you are using an EISA machine,
         you can specify the default transfer size for one
         or more DMA channels. The channels can operate in
         the following modes: 8-bit (8), 16-bit specified
         in words (16w), 16-bit specified in bytes (16b),
         or 32-bit (32). If you are not using an EISA
         machine, Windows will ignore this setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EMMExclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies a range of memory that Windows will not
         scan to find unused address space. This has the
         side effect of turning off the RAM and ROM search
         code for the range. The range (two paragraph
         values separated by a hyphen) must be between A000
         and EFFF. This scanning can interfere with some
         adapters that use the same memory area. The
         starting value is rounded down and the ending
         value is rounded up to a multiple of 16K. For
         example, you could set EMMExclude=C800-CFFF to
         prevent Windows from scanning the addresses
         C800:0000 through CFFF:000F. You can specify more
         than one range by including more than one
         EMMExclude line.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EMMInclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies a range of memory that Windows will
         treat as unused address space regardless of what
         may be there. EMMInclude takes precedence over
         EMMExclude if you specify ranges that overlap. The
         range (two values separated by a hyphen) must be
         between A000 and EFFF. The starting value is
         rounded down and the ending value is rounded up to
         a multiple of 16K.  For example, you could set
         EMMInclude=C800-CFFF to ensure that Windows can
         use the addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:000F.
         You may specify more than one range by including
         more than one EMMInclude line.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EMMPageFrame=&lt;paragraph&gt;
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the starting paragraph where the 64K
         page frame will begin when Windows in 386 enhanced
         mode cannot find a suitable page frame. Allows an
         EMM page frame in an area containing some unused
         RAM or ROM. For example, you could set
         EMMPageFrame=C400 to start the page frame at
         C400:0000.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

EMMSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default:  65,536
Purpose:  Specifies the total amount of memory available for
         mapping as expanded memory. The default value
         allocates the maximum possible amount of system
         memory as expanded memory. Specify a value for
         this setting if you run an application that  \ 
         allocates all of the available expanded memory. If
         this is the case, you cannot create new virtual
         machines. If this value is zero, then no expanded
         memory will be allocated, but the EMM driver will
         be loaded. To disable EMM and prevent the EMM
         driver from loading, use the NoEMMDriver setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

FileSysChange=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  Off in 386 enhanced mode; Not supported in
         standard mode.
Purpose:  Indicates whether File Manager automatically
         receives messages anytime a non-Windows
         application creates, renames, or deletes a file.
         If disabled, a virtual machine can run
         exclusively, even if it modifies files. Enabling
         this setting can slow down system performance
         significantly.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

Global=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default:  (all devices)
Purpose:  Defines DOS devices loaded in CONFIG.SYS that need
         to be global to the system. The default setting
         for all devices is global. However, certain
         virtual devices might specify that a DOS device be
         local (for example, MS$MOUSE). Use this setting to
         override that local specification. The &lt;device-
         name&gt; value must exactly match the case of the
         device name, or setting will not work. (Most
         device names are in all capital letters, therefore
         this value must usually be in all caps.)
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

HardDiskDMABuffer=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default:  0 for AT architecture computers; 64 for micro-
         channel computers or computers that use Direct
         Memory Access (DMA) channel 3 (unless you are
         using SMARTDrive and double-buffering is turned
         on. In this case the default is 0.)
Purpose:  Specifies the amount of memory used for the DMA
         buffer. If you are using SMARTDrive and double-
         buffering is turned on, this amount is determined
         automatically. You may need to change this value
         if you are using a hard disk that supports DMA and
         are not using SMARTDrive, or if you do not have
         double-buffering turned on.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

IdleVMWakeUpTime=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  8
Purpose:  Causes timer interrupts to periodically "wake up"
         idle virtual machines after the specified number
         of seconds have elapsed. If a virtual machine does
         not use timer interrupts (Int 8 or Int 1Ch),
         Windows will not usually force timer interrupts
         into a virtual machine unless it is active. This
         setting forces the timer interrupts to occur. The
         value for this setting is rounded  down to
         the lowest power of two (for example, 1, 2, 4, 8,
         16, 32, 64).
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

IgnoreInstalledEMM=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  No
Purpose:  If enabled, Windows will start in 386 enhanced
         mode, even when there is  an unknown expanded
         memory manager (EMM) running. This can cause the
         system to fail if memory-resident software was
         using EMM before Windows was started. Enable this
         setting only if no such software is installed or
         you are sure will not be active when you are
         running Windows. This setting applies only to
         expanded memory managers servicing physical EMS
         hardware; Windows will not disable unrecognized
         80386 expanded memory emulators.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

InDOSPolling=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  No
Purpose:  If enabled, prevents Windows from running other
         applications when memory-resident software has the
         InDOS flag set. Enabling this setting is necessary
         if the memory-resident software needs to be in a
         critical section to do operations off an INT21
         hook, but will slow down system performance
         slightly.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

INT28Critical=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True
Purpose:  Specifies whether a critical section is needed to
         handle INT28h interrupts used by memory-resident
         software. Some networks do internal task switching
         on INT28h interrupts. These interrupts might hang
         some network software, indicating the need for an
         INT28h critical section. If you are not using such
         software, you might improve Windows' task
         switching by disabling this setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

IRQ9Global=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  No
Purpose:  If enabled, converts IRQ9 masks to global. Enable
         this setting if your system hangs when accessing a
         floppy drive. Or make sure your system accesses
         the floppy drive before starting Windows.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

Keyboard=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt; (See "Device=", above)
Default:  None (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
         your system configuration.)
Purpose:  Specifies the keyboard driver that is being used
         with Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window.

===============================================================================

KeyBoostTime=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .001
Purpose:  Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) an
         application runs with  increased priority when it
         receives a keystroke. You can use this setting to
         increase the response to keystrokes when several
         background applications are running.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyBufferDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .2
Purpose:  Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to delay
         pasting keyboard input after the keyboard buffer
         is full. Some applications might require more than
         .2 seconds.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyIdleDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .5
Purpose:  Specifies how much time Windows ignores idle calls
         after simulating a keystroke into a virtual
         machine. You can set this value to 0 to speed up
         keyboard input, but some applications might slow
         down significantly.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyPasteCRSkipCount=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  10
Purpose:  Specifies the number of times that a read status
         INT 16 call should return a status of empty for
         the keyboard buffer after pasting a carriage
         return before pasting another character. When
         Windows pastes information from the Clipboard to a
         non-Windows application, it must first paste the
         information to the BIOS keyboard buffer before
         pasting it into the application. This setting is
         used to slow down fast pasting from the Clipboard
         to the keyboard buffer so that the application can
         handle all incoming characters from the buffer. If
         you seem to lose characters, or if the screen does
         not update often enough while pasting information
         from the Clipboard, increase this value. This
         setting is related to KeyPasteSkipCount.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  .003
Purpose:  Specifies how much time (in seconds) to wait
         before pasting any characters after a key has been
         pasted. Some applications might require more time
         than .003 seconds for recognition of a keystroke.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyPasteSkipCount=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  2
Purpose:  Specifies the number of times that a read status
         INT 16 call should return a status of empty for
         the keyboard buffer before pasting another
         character. When Windows pastes information from
         the Clipboard to a non-Windows application, it
         must first paste the information to the BIOS
         keyboard buffer before pasting it into the
         application. This setting is used to slow down
         fast pasting from the Clipboard to the keyboard
         buffer so that the application can handle all
         incoming characters from the buffer. If you seem
         to lose characters, or if the screen does not
         update often enough while pasting information from
         the Clipboard, increase this value. This setting
         is related to KeyPasteCRSkipCount
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KeyPasteTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  1
Purpose:  Specifies how much time (in seconds) to allow an
         application to make the necessary BIOS calls for
         reading keyboard input before Windows will change
         from the fast paste (INT16h) to the slow paste
         (INT9h) mechanism.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KybdPasswd=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True for IBM PS/2 computers; False for all other
         computers
Purpose:  Specifies whether the virtual keyboard device
         (VKD) should support PS/2 8042 commands that
         implement password security. This setting only
         applies to 8042 keyboard controllers that are
         compatible with the PS/2 computer.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

KybdReboot=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  True
Purpose:  If enabled, Windows will attempt to reboot the
         computer using a keyboard controller command. On
         some computers this method is unreliable. If your
         computer hangs while rebooting, then disable this
         setting. In this case, Windows will quit and then
         display a prompt to press CTRL+ALT+DEL a second
         time.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

Local=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default:  None (In a standard SYSTEM.INI file, Setup will
         set Local=CON. See "Purpose.")
Purpose:  Defines MS-DOS device drivers that need to be
         local to each virtual machine. The &lt;device-name&gt;
         value must exactly match the case of the device
         name, or this setting will not work. (Most device
         names are in all capital letters, therefore this
         value must usually be in all caps.) If a device
         driver is local, a separate copy of it will exist
         in each virtual machine, and each will keep
         different state information. Most device drivers
         will not function properly when this setting is
         used. An exception is CON, the DOS console device,
         which should be local to avoid filling a buffer
         with input from multiple virtual machines.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

LocalLoadHigh=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default:  False
Purpose:  Determines how extra memory in the UMB (Upper
         Memory Block) area is used when Windows in running
         on MS-DOS version 5.0. If disabled, then Windows
         uses all of the UMB area, leaving no extra UMB
         space available for Virtual Machines. If enabled,
         then Windows does not use all of the extra UMB
         area. In this case, UMB area is available locally
         to each Virtual Machine.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

LocalReboot=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
Default:  On
Purpose:  Specifies whether you can press CTRL+ALT+DEL to
         quit applications that cause an unrecoverable
         errors in 386 enhanced mode, without restarting
         Windows. If this setting is enabled, you can quit
         the applications. If this setting is disabled,
         pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL will restart your entire
         system (as it normally does.)
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

===============================================================================

LPT1AutoAssign=&lt;seconds&gt;
LPT2AutoAssign=&lt;seconds&gt;
LPT3AutoAssign=&lt;seconds&gt;
LPT4AutoAssign=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:  60

Note:  These settings apply to Windows version 3.0 only. If
      you have upgraded to Windows 3.1, these settings may
      still appear in your SYSTEM.INI file, but will have
      no affect.

===============================================================================

LRULowRateMult=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  10
Purpose:  Specifies the value used for determining the low
         paging rate sweep  frequency. The low paging rate
         sweep frequency is computed by multiplying the
         value for LRUSweepFreq by the value specified for
         this setting. Values between 1 and 65535 may be
         used.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.  (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

LRURateChngTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:  10,000
Purpose:  Specifies the length of time that the Memory
         Manager stays at high rate with no paging before
         switching to low rate, and the length of time the
         Memory Manager stays at low rate with no paging
         before turning the Least-Recently-Used (LRU) Sweep
         off.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

LRUSweepFreq=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:  250
Purpose:  Specifies the time between sweep passes. This is
         also the high paging rate sweep frequency.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.  (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

LRUSweepLen=&lt;length-in-pages&gt;
Default:  1024 (Windows computes this value by dividing the
         value of LRUSweepReset by the value of
         LRUSweepFreq)
Purpose:  Specifies the length in pages of the region swept
         on each pass. The value must be at least 1.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.  (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

LRUSweepLowWater=&lt;number&gt;
Default:  24
Purpose:  Specifies when the Least-Recently Used (LRU)
         sweeper should be turned on. When the number of
         free pages drops below this value, the sweeper is
         turned on.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting).

===============================================================================

LRUSweepReset=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:  500
Purpose:  Specifies the time desired for an ACC bit reset
         divided by 4 megabytes of pages. Therefore, the
         time to reset all ACC bits is: (number of pages in
         system+1023/1024) where 1024 pages = 4megabytes.
         The minimum value is 100.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting).
