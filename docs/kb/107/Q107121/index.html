SUMMARY
=======

The Operator Information Area (OIA)is used to display the status of a 3270
screen session. The OIA is the last (bottom) line displayed in the terminal
window of the 3270 session. Except for the initial three positions (system
connection indicators), status line indicators only appear when they apply.

The following tables describe the OIA and explain each indicator. In the table,
position refers to the column(s) that a specific indicator occupies on the OIA,
where the left-most column of the OIA is position 1. In addition, the "female"
symbol used for certain system connection and input inhibited indicators cannot
be displayed in this table. In its place is the "^" symbol.

OIA INDICATOR (POSITION)
------------------------

Symbol     Meaning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Connection (position 1):
Does not apply to the 3270 Applet.

System Connection (position 2):

A          Connection uses a non-SNA protocol.

System Connection (position 3):
b          Connected to a host application (LU-LU session).
^          Connected to host system services (SSCP-LU session).
?          Session is established, but is not connected to any host program
          (unknown).

Session ID (positions 4 - 7):
aaaa       First four characters of your configured long name session ID.

Input Inhibited messages (keyboard locked) (positions 9 - 17):
X COMMnnn  Communications error. See Communications Status
          (positions 19 - 26).
X MACHnnn  Computer check error.
X PROGnnn  Program check error. See Communications Status
          (positions 19 - 26).
X SYSTEM   Keyboard input is being processed by the host. Wait for the
          message to clear or press RESET.
X[]        The host requires more time to process your request. Wait for
          the indicator to clear or press RESET.
X -f       Function is not supported. Press RESET, and select a valid
          function.
X^&gt;        More data was typed than the field allows or can accept.

Communications Status (positions 19 - 26):
COMM500    All the link services configured for use by the connection
          were inactive.
COMM504    Communications are not established with the host. This
          message disappears as soon as communication is established with
          the host. If this message does not disappear, check to ensure
          proper settings of the host network address, local node ID, or
          local SAP.
COMM505    The host terminated the connection used by your 3270 session.
COMM510    The host has deactivated the communications link. Report the
          message to your system administrator.
COMM518    A segment was out of sequence. Contact your system
          administrator.
COMM695    A communications error occurred.
COMM5nn    The communications link is still being established; the keyboard
          is locked. Wait for the message to clear; also check Input
          Inhibited messages.
PROG703    A session control, data flow control, or network control command
          is not supported. Press RESET, and try the operation again.
PROG705    A sequence number error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
          operation again.
PROG706    A chaining error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
          operation again.
PROG707    A bracket state error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
          operation again.

          operation again.

          try the operation again.
PROG723    The LU type requested is not valid. Press RESET, and try the
          operation again.
PROG724    The screen size requested is not valid. Press RESET, and try
          the operation again.

Screen Session LU Address (positions 79 - 80):
nn         The LU address of the currently displayed 3270 screen session.

ERROR 83:
  The LU selected is not valid for the logged on user. There is a
  configuration problem if this appears, because the emulator only
  presents the user with LUs they are allowed to use. Verify the user can
  use this LU.

ERROR 85:
  The primary reason for this error is the specific LU requested is
  already in use.

ERROR 87:
  There are several possibilities for this error:
   - All the LUs in the Pool requested are in use and will not be
     available until someone logs off.
   - One or more servers or connections are inactive, and need to be
     started before all the LUs in the Pool are available.
