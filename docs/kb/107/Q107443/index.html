The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the ADMIN.EXE file included with versions
3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the ADMIN.EXE file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your ADMIN.EXE file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains ADMIN.EXE, a replacement file for the ADMIN.EXE file
included with versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This
update includes the following modifications:

- With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt .MAI file could be created
  when you export the address list to a large number of postoffices. ADMIN.EXE
  has been modified so that the correct .MAI file is created when address lists
  are exported.

- With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt SRVCONF.GLB file could be
  created when you add a directory synchronization (Dir- Sync) requestor on a
  computer that has an EtherExpress(TM) 16 network card and is running the
  Ethernet_II protocol. ADMIN.EXE has been modified so that it uses a buffer
  size of 512 bytes instead of 1K for its buffered I/O.

- If a Mail Remote for Windows user forgets his or her password or if the
  password is changed while the remote driver is in use, the password can now
  be reset.

  NOTE: This password reset only applies to the server files. Local .MMF files
  will not be affected by this change.


Notes:

- To resolve this problem, two files must be updated: the ADMIN.EXE file
  (included in this update) and the MSRMTUI.DLL file (update included in
  MSRMTUI.EXE on the MSL).

- To reset the password, you must ensure that the user's data disk was created
  using ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.12.

- Local postoffice users added with the ADMIN.EXE utility will no longer be
  assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is locked open.
  Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with the ADMIN.EXE utility
  while the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer results in the same invalid
  identification number being assigned to multiple users.

- When you use ADMIN.EXE to change the routing type defined for a hub
  postoffice, the routing type definition for any downstream postoffice is also
  updated to match the routing type of the hub postoffice.

- When you use ADMIN.EXE to remove users from a global group, access to group
  folders associated with that global group is also removed.

- Correct figures are now reported when you use the Mail Administrator program
  to create reports that involve multiple postoffices with more than 32,768
  users.

This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can occur when
you use version 3.2 or 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks:

- Groups with names 10 characters long can now be deleted successfully on other
  postoffices. With versions of ADMIN.EXE earlier than 3.2.12, if a group was
  deleted from a postoffice participating in Dir-Sync and its name was 10
  characters long, other postoffices, including the Dir-Sync server, were
  unable to delete the group from their .USR files.


- When the Admin account mailbox is greater than eight characters in length,
  the Keep Updates number will no longer change when you change the
  Administrator's Name in Config, DirSync, Server, Options.

  NOTE: To fix this problem, you need ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.13 or later
  (included in this update) and SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.13 or later, LISTDS.EXE
  version 3.2.1, and SCONFIX.EXE (updates included in SRVUPD.EXE on the MSL).


- When you modify a remote client's account using Admin, Local Admin, Modify,
  the remote user's Custom View is no longer reset to the Default view.


- ADMIN.EXE will now report an error writing to nnnnnnnn.XTN file, if locked
  open by another process.


To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Admupd.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/mail35pcnet/Update/1/WIN98/EN-US/Admupd.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download ADMUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "admupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  ADMIN.EXE (534,141 bytes, dated 04-13-95, 4:02 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your ADMIN.EXE file
-----------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\admin.exe &lt;destination&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
ADMUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
ADMIN.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-extracting
file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your ADMIN.EXE file is located in
the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\admin.exe c:\mailexe" (without the quotation marks)
