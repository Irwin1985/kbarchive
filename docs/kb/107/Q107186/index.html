VII.  Removing WSS from your system

I. Before you run the Microsoft Windows Sound System Setup

1. Other sound boards

Before installing the Microsoft Windows Sound System, open the
Windows Control Panel icon and double-click the Drivers icon.
If the list of installed drivers includes the Ad Lib,
Sound Blaster, or Pro Audio Spectrum drivers, we suggest
that you remove them by selecting the driver and clicking the Remove
button.

2. Switching to Windows Program Manager:

If you run out of disk space during Setup and need to delete some
files, you can switch to Windows Program Manager without exiting
Setup in two ways:

a.) Press Alt+Tab and choose the Windows Program Manager icon;

b.) Press Ctrl+Esc, select Program Manager from the task list and
click the Switch To button.

Follow step a or b again to switch from Program Manager back to
WSS Setup.

II. Troubleshooting

1. If you get a continuous sound repeated over and over again when you
choose the Check option and click the Sound Check button in
Setup, one of two things could be wrong:

a.) You did not remove the Ad Lib driver as described in section I.1.
above.

b.) You have one or more conflicting interrupts (IRQ). From WSS
Setup, choose the Board option and change the interrupt (IRQ) value
for your board.

2. If you do not hear any sound in Sound Finder or in the Guided Tour,
or if Music Box does not find your CD-ROM drive, make sure you have
the following entries:

a.) In your WIN.INI file in your Windows 3.1 directory:

   [MCI extensions]
   wav=waveaudio
   mid=sequencer
   rmi=sequencer

b.) In your SYSTEM.INI file in your Windows 3.1 directory:

   [MCI]
   CDAudio=mcicda.drv
   WaveAudio=mciwave.drv
   Sequencer=mciseq.drv

c.) Make sure that you have the following files in your Windows 3.1
   system directory:

   MCICDA.DRV
   MCIWAVE.DRV
   MCISEQ.DRV

3. If you're running a shared installation of Windows over a network,
you won't be able to play MIDI files.

III. Voice Pilot

You can improve recognition results by changing the
recording level in the Windows Sound System Recording Control
application.  If the level is too high, recognition will be poor.
You can access Recording Control through the Input Level
button in the Options dialog box.

As a keyboard alternative to clicking the Microphone button, press
Ctrl+Alt.

If stray noises are frequently recognized as words, you can increase
the recognition threshold by using the Sounds Must Match Words
slider control in the Options dialog box.

As a shortcut for training, editing, or deleting an item, click
the item in the Active Words list, and then choose a command from the
pop-up menu.

To move quickly to a word in the list in the Vocabulary dialog box, first
click the list, and then type the first letter of the word.
Continue typing the same letter until the highlight reaches the
desired word.

Voice Pilot can have difficulty recognizing shorter words, even after
training. If this happens, you can add longer words or phrases to the
vocabulary which perform the same actions.

IV. ProofReader

1. Multiple instances:

If you run more than one instance of Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3
for Windows, only the first instance of it will contain the ProofReader.

2. Installation sequence:

You must install your Windows spreadsheet package before you run the
WSS Setup program to install the ProofReader.

3. Removing or reinstalling ProofReader:

To remove or reinstall ProofReader from Microsoft Excel, please
follow your Microsoft Excel documentation on how to remove or install
the "ProofReader For Excel" add-in.

To remove or reinstall ProofReader for Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows,
please follow your Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows documentation on how to
remove or install the "123RDR" add-in.

V. Compatibility issues

1. The Microsoft Windows Sound System board may not work with other
sound boards. We recommend that you remove all other sound drivers
from the Windows Control Panel Drivers application and remove other
sound boards from your machine.

The synthesis chip on the WSS board can conflict with those on other
sound boards.

If you use multiple sound boards and drivers, you can encounter
interrupt (IRQ), I/O address, and/or DMA channel conflicts which
can cause your system to hang or repeat sounds.

2. Using MIDI Sequencing Software with your WSS Board:

There are some known incompatibilities with certain Musical
Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) sequencing software packages.

The WSS Sound Finder cannot play a file with an extension of
.MID or .RMI while a sequencing program is open, regardless of
whether a file is actually loaded into the sequencer. In this
situation, you can play the file through the Windows Sound
System board using either your sequencing program or Sound
Finder. If you would like to use Sound Finder to browse MIDI
files and additional file types as well, close your sequencer before
using Sound Finder. You should find that Sound Finder now plays MIDI
files without a problem.

If you experience difficulties using your MIDI sequencer with
your WSS board:

    i.)    Consult the WSS documentation to ensure you have properly
           installed and configured both the board and the software.

    ii.)   Consult your sequencer's documentation for additional
           assistance.

    iii.)  If you are still experiencing problems, contact Microsoft
           Product Support Services.

VI. Modifications to the WSS User's Guide information

1. When you double-click on a file in Windows File Manager, the
file is not loaded into Sound Finder. Instead, the file is loaded into
Quick Recorder.

2. After performing a Paste Mix command in Quick Recorder, the Undo command
works correctly.

VII. Removing WSS from your system

If you ever want to remove everything associated with the Windows
Sound System from your machine, there is a file called DEINSTAL.TXT
in your WSS directory (c:\sndsys by default) which documents every
file installed, its location, and how to remove it from
your system.
