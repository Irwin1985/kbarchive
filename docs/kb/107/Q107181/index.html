1. Troubleshooting

1.1 Trouble Hearing Sound with Sound Finder or Music Box

   If you do not hear sound when using Sound Finder or
   if Music Box cannot find your CD-ROM drive, ensure
   that you have the following entries or files in the
   appropriate locations:

   In the WIN.INI file in the Windows 3.1 directory:

       [MCI extensions]
       wav=waveaudio
       mid=sequencer
       rmi=sequencer

   In the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows 3.1 directory:

       [MCI]
       CDAudio=mcicda.drv
       WaveAudio=mciwave.drv
       Sequencer=mciseq.drv

   In the Windows 3.1 system directory:

             MCICDA.DRV
             MCIWAVE.DRV
             MCISEQ.DRV

1.2 Windows on a Network Installation

   If you're running Windows from a network installation, you cannot
   play MIDI files.  You must install Windows on your local hard disk
   to play MIDI files.

   If you're running Windows from a network installation, CTL3D.DLL
   does not get copied to your hard disk.  Either install Windows on
   your local hard disk, or copy CTL3D.DLL to your Windows Sound System
   directory on your local hard disk.

1.3 Using Music Box with a Future Domain SCSI Card

   If you have a Future Domain SCSI card installed in your computer
   and Music Box doesn't play, ensure that you have the latest version
   of the CD-ROM driver, FDCD.SYS (version 2.23 or later).

1.4 Using Quick Recorder with a 386 Computer with a 25 MHz or Lower CPU

   Quick Recorder cannot record reliably at high sampling rates on some
   computers, particulary 386 computers with 25 megahertz (MHz) or
   lower CPUs.

   To correct the problem:

   1. Record at a sampling rate lower than CD Quality (less than 44
      kHz). This reduces your computer's processing.

   2. Close other applications, if possible.

   3. If you must make CD-quality recordings, keep them as short
      as possible.

1.5 Playing Stereophonic Files with a Monophonic Audio Board

   Quick Recorder cannot play some CD-quality stereophonic files in
   Recorder view. Try playing these files using Sound Finder or use
   Quick Recorder in Expanded View.

1.6 Playing MIDI Files with Sound Blaster Pro Audio Hardware

   If you are using Sound Blaster Pro audio hardware, and you have
   the microphone turned on in Voice Pilot, you will not be able to
   hear a MIDI file while it is playing. Turn off the microphone.

1.7 Opening More Than One Instance of a Quick Recorder File

   To open more than one instance of a Quick Recorder file, you must
   have SHARE.EXE installed in MS-DOS.  For instructions on installing
   SHARE.EXE, see the "MS-DOS User's Guide."

1.8 Detecting Installed Hardware

   If your audio hardware does not function correctly, ensure
   that you selected the right audio hardware when you ran Setup.
   If an outdated driver is present, Setup may not detect the presence
   of the correct audio hardware.

1.9 Playing 44kHz files with Sound Blaster Pro Audio Board

   Quick Recorder cannot play some 44kHz stereophonic files in
   Recorder view. Try playing these files using Sound Finder or use
   Quick Recorder in Expanded View.

2. Voice Pilot

2.1  Using Multiple Mixer Devices

    Voice Pilot uses the mixer device with the lowest number (the one
    listed in the first "mixerX=" line in your SYSTEM.INI file) that
    meets its requirements. If you want to use a driver other than the
    default driver for your Voice Pilot input, manually renumber the
    "mixerX=" lines in your SYSTEM.INI file so that the number of the
    mixer device you want to use is the lowest.

2.2 Confirmation Option Limitations

   The Confirmation option cannot be used on commands that are not
   top-level commands; that is, the Confirmation option can be used
   only with commands that appear on the menu bar or with commands that
   are not contained on menus.

2.3 Using Audio Cues

   If you are using Voice Pilot's audio cues, Voice Pilot may attempt
   to sound a cue at the same time another application, or VoicePilot
   itself, tries to issue a sound. As a result, you may not be able to
   use Voice Pilot to start ProofReader or you may receive a warning
   that the device is being used by another application. To correct
   this situation, in the Audio Cues section of the Preferences dialog
   box, select None.

3. ProofReader

3.1 Versions Supported

   ProofReader is supported only in Microsoft Excel version 3.0 or
   higher and Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows versions 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1.01, and 4.

3.2 Using Multiple Instances

   If you run more than one instance of Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3
   for Windows, ProofReader is present only on the menu of the first
   instance.

3.3 Installation Sequence

   You must install your Windows-based spreadsheet application before
   installing ProofReader with the Windows Sound System Setup program.

3.4 Removing or Reinstalling ProofReader

   To remove or reinstall ProofReader for Microsoft Excel, see your
   Microsoft Excel documentation for information on how to remove or
   install an add-in.

   To remove or reinstall ProofReader for Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows
   (123RDR), see your Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows documentation for
   information on how to remove or install an add-in.

3.5 ProofReader Dictionary for Non-U.S. English-Speaking Countries

   The ProofReader dictionary NON-US.DCT contains terms that
   accommodate the differences between English as spoken in the United
   States and English as spoken in some other English-speaking
   countries.

   To use this dictionary, add it to the list of active ProofReader
   dictionaries:

   1. From the Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows
      Proof menu, choose Options.

      The Options dialog box appears.

   2. In the Category box, choose Dictionary.

      The Dictionaries dialog box appears.

   3. Choose Add Dictionary.

      The Add Dictionary dialog box appears.

   4. In the Directories box, choose the Windows Sound
      System directory (the default is C:\SNDSYS).

      NOTE: If you installed Windows Sound System
            in a directory other than C:\SNDSYS,
            choose the proper directory name.

      The list of available dictionaries (*.DCT files)
      appears in the File Name box.

   5. In the File Name box, select NON-US.DCT.

   6. Choose OK.

   7. Choose Done.

3.6 Using ProofReader for Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and
   International Country Settings

   Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows uses its own country settings, not
   the country settings used by Windows. If ProofReader does
   not read some numbers correctly, verify that the country
   settings selected in the Windows Control Panel match the
   country settings that are set for Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows.

3.7 Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows Release 4

   Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 does not support accelerator keys for
   add-ins, such as ProofReader.  Use the mouse or the arrow
   and Enter keys to select commands.

4. Using Windows Sound System with Microsoft Windows NT(TM)

  The Windows Sound System sound board can be used in ISA/EISA
  computers running Microsoft Windows NT. Sound applications
  that are shipped with Windows NT play sounds through the
  Windows Sound System sound board by using an audio driver
  included with Windows NT. Windows NT-based applications that
  use the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Sound Application
  Programming Interfaces (APIs) should operate properly with the
  Windows Sound System sound board.

5. Compatibility with Windows Sound System

5.1 Windows Sound System and Other Audio Drivers

   The Windows Sound System audio driver may conflict with other
   audio drivers. If you use multiple sound boards and drivers,
   you may experience interrupt (IRQ) channel, I/O address, or
   DMA channel conflicts that can cause your computer to stop
   or to repeat sounds. Therefore, we recommend that you remove
   all other audio drivers by using the Windows Control Panel
   Drivers application.

   If you remove an old audio board and install a new board,
   you may have to manually remove the driver entries from
   your SYSTEM.INI file.

   For information on how to remove Windows Sound System software,
   see DEINSTAL.TXT in your Windows Sound System directory (the
   default is C:\SNDSYS).

5.2 Windows Sound System and MIDI Sequencing Software

   Windows Sound System is incompatible with certain Musical
   Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) sequencing applications.

   Sound Finder cannot play a file with an .MID or an .RMI
   extension while a sequencing application is open, regardless
   of whether a file is actually loaded into the sequencer. If
   you want to use Sound Finder to browse MIDI files and other
   types of files, close your sequencer first. Alternatively,
   you can use your sequencing application to play MIDI files.

   Finale 2.2 for Windows from Coda Music Technology is compatible
   with the Windows Sound System sound board and software if you
   modify the WIN.INI file. For more information on using
   Finale for Windows or MusicProse for Windows with the
   Windows Sound System sound board, contact Coda Music
   Technology at (612) 937-9611.

   If you experience difficulties while using your MIDI sequencer
   with your Windows Sound System sound board:

   1. See the Windows Sound System documentation to ensure you
      have installed and configured both the sound board and
      the software properly.

   2. See the documentation for your sequencer.

   3. If you continue to experience problems, contact Microsoft
      Product Support Services.

5.3 Potential IRQ Conflicts in IBM PC/AT Bus Class Computers

   IRQ 2 is unavailable to add-in cards on IBM PC/AT bus class
   computers. If you are using an IBM PC/AT bus class computer
   and you select IRQ 2, your selection defaults to IRQ 9.

5.4 Installing EMM386 on Stacked Drives

   Installing Windows Sound System on stacked drives and
   running the MS-DOS Configuration program to enable
   Sound Blaster compatiblity may cause your stacker drive
   to load incorrectly. Stacked drives are often loaded
   into UMB space; therefore, EMM386 must be present to
   provide UMBs. Copy EMM386 onto a nonstacked boot drive.
   The nonstacked drive is usually the drive that contains
   the MS-DOS system files.

5.5 Using IRQ 7 on Gateway 2000 Computers

   Windows Sound System cannot use IRQ 7 on some Gateway
   2000 computers. However, you may be able to make IRQ 7
   available for use on such a computer by changing a
   BIOS setting.  Contact your Gateway 2000 representative
   to determine how to make IRQ 7 available. (For information
   on IRQ settings, see the "Microsoft Windows Sound
   System Software User's Guide.")

5.6 Using Windows Sound System in Windows Standard Mode

   You cannot perform a sound check if you are running
   Setup in Windows Standard mode.  To check hardware
   operation, run Windows in Enhanced mode or use Sound
   Finder or Quick Recorder to play a file.

5.7 IRQ and DMA Conflicts on EISA Machines

   If an EISA machine is incorrectly configured, Windows
   Sound System may report that all IRQ or DMA channels are
   in use.

   To solve this problem:

   1. Use the EISA configuration utility supplied by your
      hardware manufacturer to configure the computer properly.
      This is the preferred solution.

   -or-

   2. Disable the EISA resource scan of SNDSYS.DRV and
      VSNDSYS.386 by adding the EnableEISAResourceScan=FALSE
      flag to the [SNDSYS.DRV] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
      Note that disabling this feature can cause problems with
      enhanced SCSI adapters, such as the Adaptec 1742.

6. Removing Windows Sound System from Your Computer

  If you want to remove Windows Sound System from your computer,
  see DEINSTAL.TXT, in your Windows Sound System directory
  (C:\SNDSYS by default).

7. Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, and Sound Blaster
  16 ASP Issues

  Setting the MIDIInPersistence= variable in the [WSSSBPRO.DRV]
  or [WSSSB16.DRV] section of your SYSTEM.INI file allows you
  to configure the amount of data that will be processed in the
  MIDI-in interrupt.  The default value is 50, the recommended
  range is 50 to 1024. Decreasing this value may prevent the
  MIDI-in device from being completely serviced and may
  cause data loss or may stop input.

8. Sound Blaster Compatibility with the Windows Sound System Sound Board

8.1 Problems Playing Music

   If your game offers the choice, select Ad Lib
   compatibility for music output and Sound Blaster
   compatibility for sound effects.  This will prevent
   music from playing too slowly.

8.2 Using GAMES.PIF

   If you're using a user-specified shell in MS-DOS,
   ensure that the file GAMES.PIF (located in the directory
   in which you installed Windows Sound System, C:SNDSYS
   by default) references the same shell as your COMSPEC system
   variable.  To edit the GAMES.PIF file, use Windows PIF
   Editor. For more information on the COMSPEC system variable,
   see your MS-DOS documentation.

8.3 Choosing between Sound Blaster andSound Blaster Pro

   If your game offers choice between Sound Blaster and Sound
   Blaster Pro, you must select Sound Blaster, not Sound
   Blaster Pro, as your audio board.

8.4 Playing Mickey's ABC

   Mickey's ABC cannot detect the presence of
   the Windows Sound System sound board. However, it will
   work correctly if you select Ad Lib compatibility
   as the option for music.

8.5 Playing Alphabet Blocks

   If you experience problems playing Sierra On-Line
   Alphabet Blocks with the Windows Sound System sound
   board, add AcceptCloseSamplingRates=TRUE to the
   [SNDSYS.DRV] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
   Alphabet Blocks uses a nonstandard sampling rate
   that is not directly supported by the Windows Sound
   System sound board. Setting this flag to true allows
   the driver to accept sampling rates that are within
   5% of the actual supported rate.

8.6 Playing Broderbund Games

   If you experience problems while playing Broderbund
   games, set the VirtualHDIRQ=FALSE switch in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
