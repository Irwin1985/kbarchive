SUMMARY
=======

If you encounter problems installing Encarta 1994 using SETUP.EXE, use the
INSTALL.BAT file to manually install Encarta and complete the instruction in the
MSETUP.WRI file. MSETUP.WRI has instructions for a manual installation including
how to correctly execute INSTALL.BAT. MSETUP.WRI is found on the Encarta 1994
CD. The file is located in the X:\MSSTP\MANUAL directory, where X: is the CDROM
drive.

CAUTION: Do not use these steps if your are using Microsoft Windows 95 or
Microsoft Windows NT. The manual installation uses a batch file that copies
Windows 3.x system files onto your hard drive. Allowing the system files to be
overwritten in Windows 95 or Windows NT may cause improper system performance.

MSETUP.WRI
----------

ENCARTA MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you encounter difficulties in setting up Encarta with the SETUP program, you
will still be able to fully install and use Encarta by doing a Manual
Installation using INSTALL.BAT, a batch file that will copy files from the CD to
your hard disk. The normal Encarta setup program gives you the option of two
types of installation: Faster (Recommended) and Slower (Minimum). The
Recommended installation requires 8.4 megabytes of disk space and provides
faster performance. The Minimum installation requires only 2.5 megabytes of disk
space but provides slower performance. To have INSTALL copy the files for the
installation of your choice, specify the install option as shown below.

Once the copying is completed, it will be necessary to modify your WIN.INI and
SYSTEM.INI files. This can be easily done by opening Notepad or the Windows text
editor of your choice and making the following changes to the specified files.
For the sake of convenience, you may want to copy the changes from this document
and paste them into the appropriate .INI files at the end of the specified
sections. Be sure to save the changes as you make them.

Running INSTALL.BAT

It is recommended that you exit Windows before running INSTALL.BAT to prevent
possible difficulties with replacement of some system files. The INSTALL.BAT
file is located in the x:\MSSTP\MANUAL directory of your Encarta CD (where 'x'
is the drive corresponding to your CD-ROM drive). The CD-ROM drive will be
referred to as [source] later in these instructions.

To run INSTALL.BAT, select File. Run from the Program Manager and type:

  "INSTALL [dest] [windows dir] [install option]" (without the quotation marks)

[dest] is the path and directory to which you want to install Encarta (usually
C:\ENCARTA) [windows] is the path to your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS)
[install option] is the installation option you select -- R = Recommended, M =
Minimum.

Note: Remember the installation you selected, Recommended(R) or Minimum(M), when
making the changes to the .INI files as described below.

For example:

     INSTALL C:\ENCARTA C:\WINDOWS R

installs Encarta to your C drive in the ENCARTA directory, tells the batch file
that Windows is located on your C drive in the WINDOWS directory, and specifies
that you would like to install the Recommended (Faster) installation. Once this
batch file has finished, you will need to make the changes outlined below.

Changes to the WIN.INI file (usually located in C:\WINDOWS)

For either installation, add the following seven lines to the section labeled
[Fonts]. If you have installed Microsoft multimedia software before, these line
may already be present. If they are present, do not add them again.

  V1 Lucida Sans=v1sp.fon
  V2 Lucida Sans=v2sp.fon
  V3 Lucida Sans=v3sp.fon
  V4 Lucida Sans=v4sp.fon
  V5 Lucida Sans=v5sp.fon
  V6 Lucida Sans=v6sp.fon
  V7 Lucida Sans=v7sp.fon

For the Recommended installation, create a section labeled [Encarta] and add the
following four lines beneath it :

  FILE_usa.dct=
  FILE_usa.ths=
  ThsFile=[dest]\usa.ths
  DctFile=[source]encarta\usa.dct

For the Minimum installation, create a section labeled [Encarta] and add the
following four lines beneath it:

  FILE_usa.dct=
  FILE_usa.ths=
  ThsFile=[source]\encarta\usa.ths
  DctFile=[source]\encarta\usa.dct

For either installation, add the following lines to the section labeled [mci
extensions]:

  AVI=AVIVideo
  mmm=MMMovie

For either installation, add the following to the section labeled [Microsoft
Multimedia Catalog]. If the section does not exist, then create it.

  catalognum=1
  path=[source]\mmcat\
  parentCD=Microsoft Encarta 1994

Save your WIN.INI file after making these changes.

Changes to the SYSTEM.INI file (usually located in C:\WINDOWS)

For either installation, add the following lines to the section labeled
[Drivers]:

  Wavemapper=msacm.drv
  VIDC.CVID=iccvid.drv

For either installation, add the following lines to the section labeled [mci]:

  MMMovie=mcimmp.drv
  AVIVideo=mciavi.drv

For either installation, add the following line to the section labeled [MSACM].
If the section does not exist, then create it.

  Install=msadpcm.acm

Save your SYSTEM.INI file after making these changes.

Changes to the CONTROL.INI file (usually located in C:\WINDOWS)

For either installation, add the following line to the section labeled
[Userinstallable.driver]:

  VIDC.CVID=iccvid.drv

For either installation, add the following line to the section labeled
[related.desc]:

  VIDC.CVID=

Save your CONTROL.INI file after making these changes.

Copying the ENCARTA.INI to your Windows directory

In the \MSSTP\MANUAL directory is a sample ENCARTA.INI file that is preset with
all default Encarta settings for the Recommended installation. Copy the file
into your Windows directory. If [dest] is C:\ENCARTA and your CD-ROM is D: then
no changes are necessary. If you setup the Minimum installation, Encarta is in a
directory other than C:\ENCARTA, or your CD-ROM drive is not D:, then make the
following changes to the [94Options] section:

Recommended
CodePath=[dest]
BookPath=[source]\ENCYC94\
SpellFile=[dest]\ENCART94.LEX

Minimum
CodePath=[source]\ENCARTA
BookPath=[source]\ENCYC94\
SpellFile=[dest]\ENCART94.LEX

Create a new Program Group called "Microsoft Multimedia" in the Program Manager
(see your Windows manual for more information on creating a Program Group).

Note: The Microsoft Multimedia Catalog requires that your video card be able to
display 256 or more colors.

If you are installing the Recommended version, create the following icons in the
Program Group called Microsoft Multimedia:

Item 1

  Description:      Microsoft Encarta 1994
  Command line:      [dest]\encart94.exe
  Working directory:   [dest]

Item 2

  Description:      READ ME: Encarta Tips
  Command line:      write.exe [dest]\readme.wri
  Working directory:

Item 3

  Description:      Microsoft Multimedia Catalog
  Command line:      catstub.exe
  Working directory:

If you are installing the Minumum version, create the following icons in the
Program Group called Microsoft Multimedia:

Item 1

  Description:      Microsoft Encarta 1994
  Command line:      [source]\encarta\encart94.exe
  Working directory:   [source]\encarta

Item 2

  Description:      READ ME: Encarta Tips
  Command line:      write.exe [dest]\readme.wri
  Working directory:

Item 3

  Description:      Microsoft Multimedia Catalog
  Command line:      catstub.exe
  Working directory:
