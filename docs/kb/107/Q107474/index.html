The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 may not install properly when you use the SETUP /N
command from a shared copy that is located on a Microsoft LAN Manager- or
Windows NT-based server. This article explains how to correctly set up a shared
copy of Windows for Workgroups on a LAN Manager-based network.

Please note that when Windows for Workgroups is set up this way, Windows for
Workgroups server capabilities are not available because users must start the
real-mode network redirector to access the shared files on the server. The
Windows for Workgroups server cannot run when the real-mode redirector is
started. This behavior is different from that of Windows for Workgroups 3.1
(because of changes made in 3.11 to facilitate use of the Installable File
System [IFS] Manager).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Users wanting to set up a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups must first have
a real-mode networking client installed that is able to connect to the file
server where the shared copy of Windows for Workgroups had been installed. This
article describes how to set up Windows for Workgroups with either Workgroups
Connections 1.0 or the Microsoft LAN Manager client, which is included in the
Microsoft Network client. This article assumes that SETUP /A has already been
completed and the shared files are already located on the file server.

Workgroup Connections
---------------------

Workgroup Connections is a real-mode networking client that is normally used to
connect to Windows for Workgroups servers. Use the following steps to set up a
shared copy of Windows for Workgroups with Workgroup Connections:

1. Install Workgroup Connections in a clean directory. The Setup program
  defaults to the DOS directory; do NOT install to this directory. If you do
  so, you install Windows for Workgroups user files over the top of this
  directory.

2. Use the Workgroup Connections network to connect to the file server's Windows
  for Workgroups share with drive &lt;W&gt;. (It does not matter which drive
  you use, but you must remember the drive letter because the same drive must
  be used after Windows for Workgroups has been set up.)

3. Run the Windows for Workgroups SETUP /N command and let Windows for
  Workgroups install to the same directory in which you installed Workgroup
  Connections. Setup should automatically choose the Microsoft Windows Network,
  and you should verify that your network card driver is set up properly. Be
  sure to let Setup configure your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

4. Once Setup is complete, reboot the machine. The real-mode network should
  start and log you on to the network. Use the NET USE command to connect drive
  &lt;W&gt; to the file server's Windows for Workgroups share. (This drive
  letter should be the same one you used in step 2.)

5. Use the WIN command to start Windows for Workgroups. The first time you start
  Windows for Workgroups, a warning message states that you do not have sharing
  capabilities (because the real-mode network is started). You can ignore this
  message and choose the NO button to prevent it from coming up again.

Microsoft Network Client (LAN Manager Client)
---------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Network Client is a real-mode LAN Manager client that is available
for download from the Internet server [type "GOWINNT ! AdvSys\MSClient" (without
the quotation marks)]. If you can't access these services, the Microsoft Network
client is available for sale from Microsoft Sales and Service at (800)
426-9400.
Use the following steps to set up a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups with
the LAN Manager client:

1. Use the LAN Manager client to connect to the file server's Windows for
  Workgroups share with drive &lt;W&gt;. (It doesn't matter which drive you
  use, but you must remember the drive letter because the same drive must be
  used after Windows for Workgroups has been set up.)

2. Run the Windows for Workgroups SETUP /N command and direct Windows for
  Workgroups to a clean directory. Do not set up Windows for Workgroups in the
  directory that LAN Manager is in. (If you do, the PROTOCOL.INI file is not
  set up correctly.) Setup should automatically choose the Microsoft Windows
  Network, and you should verify that your network card driver is set up
  properly. Be sure to let Setup configure your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  files, and make sure that all references to LAN Manager are removed from both
  files.

3. Once Setup is complete, reboot the machine. The real-mode network should
  start and log you on to the network. Use the NET USE command to connect drive
  &lt;W&gt; to the file server's Windows for Workgroups share. This drive
  letter should be the same drive letter you used in step 1.

4. Use the WIN command to start Windows for Workgroups. The first time you start
  Windows for Workgroups, a warning message states you do not have sharing
  capabilities (because the real-mode network is started). You can ignore this
  message and choose the NO button to prevent it from coming up again.
