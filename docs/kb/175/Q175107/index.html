IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to download the Offline Address Book, the following error message
may occur:

  The directory for the local Microsoft Exchange offline address book
  files does not exist.

If you click OK, the following message occurs:

  Unable to download the offline Address Book. The Microsoft Exchange Address
  Book could not be accessed.

NOTE: Only Exchange clients installed from a network share point exhibit these
symptoms.

CAUSE
=====

The Default.prf file on the network share point has the OfflineAddressBookPath
value set incorrectly, which causes the error message for the profiles created
from it.

The location specified in the Exchange user's profile for the Offline Address
Book files is invalid. The location of the Offline Address Book is not
configurable through the Exchange client. By default the Offline Address Book is
kept in the Windows directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following method can be used to modify the Default.prf. If the Default.prf
file is present, edit the file using a text editor such as Notepad, and complete
these steps:

1. In the [Service2] section, add this entry:

     OfflineAddressBookPath= &lt;path to the offline Address Book&gt;

  If this entry already exists, modify the path to what you want.

2. Save the file, and exit out of the text editor.

New profiles created using this Default.prf will now point to the correct
location for the Offline Address Book files.

To modify an existing profile, perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Assuming that the Offline Address Book location needs to be modified for a
profile with the name "Default Exchange Profile," use the procedure that is
appropriate for your operating system to change it.

For Windows NT:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion
  \Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\Default Exchange Profile

3. Open the following key:

  13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a

4. Now look for the value: 001e660e This should be type REG_SZ and should
  contain the path to OAB files. Modify the string associated with this value
  to be the new directory for the OAB files. If this value does not exist, then
  add a new value with the following information:

     Value Name: 001e660e
     Data Type: REG_SZ
     String: &lt;Location of the OAB Files&gt;

For Windows 95:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging
  Subsystem\Profiles\Default Exchange Profile

3. Open the following key:

  13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a

4. Now look for the value: 001e660e This should be type REG_SZ and should
  contain the path to OAB files. Modify the string associated with this value
  to be the new directory for the OAB files. If this value does not exist, then
  add a new value with the following information:

     Value Name: 001e660e
     Data Type: REG_SZ
     String: &lt;Location of the OAB Files&gt;

For Windows 3.x:

1. Open the Profiles.ini file and find the filename for the profile "Default
  Exchange Profile." The file name could be 5d630a00 or something similar.

2. Exit the editor and open the 5d630a00.ini file.

3. Locate the section with the heading [13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a]. Look
  for an entry with the name, 001e660e. The value of this entry is the path to
  the OAB files. Modify the value to the location you prefer.

  If this entry does not exist, locate the section with the heading
  13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a] and add the following line to it:

       001e660e=&lt;path to OAB files&gt;

4. Open the client again and download the Offline Address Book.
