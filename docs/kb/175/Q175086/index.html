The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If user profiles are enabled in Windows 95, and you specify settings using the
Regional Settings tool in Control Panel that are different from the default
regional settings, your regional settings may not be applied when you log on to
Windows 95.

If you use the "Close all programs and log on as a different user" option to shut
down Windows 95, the regional settings for the previous user are applied. If you
restart Windows, the default regional settings are applied.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:
