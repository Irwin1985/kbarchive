-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Top-Level form and one or more child forms within it, and then closing
the Top-Level form, may produce error messages or phantom copies of the
top-level form. Following these problems the Project Manager may produce Access
Violations when you try to Build/Rebuild a project.

RESOLUTION
==========

The above problems occur in the development version of Visual FoxPro. If the
Top-Level form is being created for use as an EXE and the EXE is designed to end
when the Top-Level form is closed, there should be no problems using the
Top-Level form with its child forms.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following symptoms may appear when developing a project containing a
Top-Level form that has child forms contained within it. Running a Top- Level
form and one or more child forms within it and then closing the Top- Level form,
may cause the following symptoms in Visual FoxPro:

1. The error message "FORMS is not an object." This happens while closing the
  Top-Level form when child forms are open within it.

2. "Phantom" copies of the Top-Level form remaining on the Windows Taskbar for
  each time the Top-Level form was run and closed with a child form within.
  They can be activated and the form's border and title bar will show but they
  cannot be moved, minimized or maximized, or closed. They are also
  transparent, whatever application is behind them can be seen but not accessed
  through the form. Use the Windows Taskbar or click on the visible portion of
  the application outside of the "phantom" Top-Level form to activate the
  desired application. These "phantom" forms only go away if Visual FoxPro is
  shut down.

3. Choosing the Build button in the Project Manager to build or rebuild anything
  will cause Visual FoxPro to crash with an Access Violation in Windows NT or
  to end with the "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be
  shut down" error message in Windows 95. Using the command line BUILD
  commands(BUILD PROJECT, BUILD EXE, BUILD APP or BUILD DLL) will also cause
  the errors. This only happens if there is a "phantom" form as described in #2
  above.

  In Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3, the exact error message with addresses
  is this:

  

     An application error has occurred and an application error log is
     being generated.
                      vfp.exe
     Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x004025a0

  In Windows 95, the details of the error message is this:

  VFP caused an invalid page fault in module VFP.EXE at 0137:00402960.
  Registers: &lt;register info not repeated in this article&gt;

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To reproduce this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q175625 FILE: Use Topclose.exe to Close Child Forms Of Top-Level Forms

Work with the Almost.pjx project and the Almost.app file. Step #4 in the
Additional Information section of the above mentioned article refers to the
problem.

NOTE: The following information assumes that the sample files from the above
mentioned KB article has been downloaded and explored.

Just run the Almost.app and follow the instructions on the Top-Level form to see
the "phantom" form(s) appear. After there is at least one "phantom" form, try
rebuilding the Almost.pjx and Visual FoxPro should crash.

To get the error message "FORMS is not an object", make the following
modifications to the QueryUnload method of thE Almost.scx form in the Almost.pjx
project:

1. Replace the DO WHILE loop with a FOR...ENDFOR loop. To do this, remark out
  the following line of code:

        DO WHILE _Screen.ActiveForm.Caption != "Good Top-Level Form"

  and replace it with the following two lines of code:

           FOR x=1 TO xx
           IF _SCREEN.FORMS(x).CAPTION != "Good Top-Level Form"

  The variable xx is already setup at the beginning of the QueryUnload code to
  contain _Screen.FormCount. At the end of the DO WHILE loop, remark out the
  following line of code:

        ENDDO

  and replace it with the following two lines of code:

           ENDIF
           ENDFOR

2. Save the form and rebuild the application.

3. Run the Almost.app application and open at least one child form and then
  close the Top-Level form. The error message "FORMS is not an object" should
  appear before all the forms are closed.
