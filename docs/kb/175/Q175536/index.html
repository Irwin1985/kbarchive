The information in this article applies to:

- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Ocean for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Scholastic's Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean for the
Macintosh, version 1.0, you receive the following error message:

  The CD was ejected while it was in used.

NOTE: The word "used" is misspelled in the error message--it should be "use."

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by one of the following:

- The System or application folders are protected.

- The computer cannot read the compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure the System Folder and application folders are
not protected. If the folders are protected, remove the protection by following
these steps:

To remove the protection on the System Folder and applications folders, do the
following:

1. On the Apple Menu, point to or click Control Panels, and then click General
  Controls.

2. In the Folder Protection area, click the Protect System Folder and the
  Protect Applications Folders check boxes to clear them.

If the System Folder and application folders are not protected, use the following
steps to verify that your compact disc is readable and working correctly.

1. Clean the compact disc. Focus on fingerprints, smudges, and dust. These can
  often cause problems with reading the disc.
   - Gently wipe the silver side of the disc with a soft, lint-free cotton
     cloth. Do not use paper cloth, which may scratch the plastic or leave
     streaks.

   - Wipe from the center out. Do not use a circular motion.

2. Ensure you are using the Apple CD-ROM Extension by following these steps:
  a. On the Apple menu, point to or click Control Panels, and then click
     Extensions Manager.

  b. Make sure Apple CD-ROM is listed under Extensions.

3. If Apple CD-ROM is not listed, you will need to install it from your Apple
  Macintosh System Software compact disc.
