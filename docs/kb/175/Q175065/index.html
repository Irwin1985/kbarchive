SUMMARY
=======

This article lists frequently asked questions about using Chat on MSN, The
Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- What can I do if someone is causing a problem in a chat session?

  If you see inappropriate behavior in a chat room, please submit a report to
  MSN Member Services by clicking the E-mail Member Support icon found on the
  Member Services home page at http://memberservices.msn.com

- How do I send a message in Chat?

  To send a message in Chat, type your message in the Compose box, and then
  click Send.

  NOTE: If the host designates you as a spectator rather than a participant, you
  cannot send messages in Chat.

- Why do some chat rooms have comic figures?

  One of the chat programs used on MSN is Microsoft Comic Chat. This program
  has the option of choosing graphics mode (comic figures) or text mode.

  NOTE: The graphics mode is more suitable for chat rooms with relatively few
  participants. The text-only mode is more effective in highly populated chat
  rooms.

- How do I contact a chat host?

  To contact a chat host, use the following steps:

  -In the chat room, you see an icon identifying the host in the member list.
  -Send an e-mail message to the name listed next to the host icon.

  NOTE: If there is no host icon, the chat room does not have a host.

- What is MSN doing to keep Chat Central safe and comfortable?

  One feature of Chat on MSN is that a member can create, host, and name their
  own chat room. MSN has instituted a policy regarding the names and the topics
  of member-created chat rooms. All chat rooms that use offensive words in the
  name or the topic of the room are marked as hidden. A hidden chat room does
  not appear on the MSN chat room list or in search results. Also, any chat
  room names that start with a symbol are hidden. All MSN-created chats begin
  with an * and are listed together at the top of the chat room list.
