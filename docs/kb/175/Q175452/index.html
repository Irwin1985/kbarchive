To:
"d. 126.1.0.0
This is an invalid address because it falls outside the valid host ID range."

Change:
"f. 190.7.2.0
This is a valid address"

To:
"f. 190.7.2.0
This is an invalid address because it falls outside the valid host ID range."

Page 66 lists valid host IDs.


Page 361: Mismatched Answers In Table
-------------------------------------

In the middle Practice Answers section on page 361, the answers for "Windows NT
Workstation computers" and "UNIX workstations" are mismatched. The chart table
appear as follows:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type of TCP/IP host              | IP address range                                                                                                                    | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Windows NT Server computers      | Assign high numbers to all servers, for instance 200-250.                                                                           | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Windows NT Workstation computers | Assign numbers to the Windows NT Workstation computers using a different octet than that used by the servers and UNIX workstations. | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| UNIX workstations                | Assign low numbers to all UNIX workstations, for instance 150-200.                                                                  | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

address of your default gateway to binary format, and..."

To:
"Using the information below, convert your computer's IP address and the IP
address of your second computer to binary format, and..."


Page 367: Incorrect Explanation For Answer

"The only way to get a network ID of 254 is to use the entire octet, in this case
the third octet."

To:
"The only way to get a host ID of 254 is to use the entire octet, in this case
the third octet."
