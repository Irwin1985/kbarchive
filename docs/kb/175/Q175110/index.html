The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An SNA Server subdomain is the name given to a logical grouping of SNA servers
and resources (in other words, link services, connections, LU's, sessions, and
users) within a given NT domain that share the same configuration file. The
logical grouping of SNA Server's in this manner can be used to reduce the
administration and configuration overhead associated with managing a collection
resouces.

There may be times however, when you need to change the name of the SNA Server
subdomain but would prefer not to go through the process of removing and
reinstalling SNA Server. Outlined below are the steps that can be performed to
change the name of the subdomain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information concerning which subdomain an SNA Server belongs to is stored in
both the registry and Snaexp.snav. Snaexp.snav contains information regarding
the size and position of the main SNA Server Manager window, as well as which
part of a subdomain is displayed in each multiple document interface (MDI)
window and the size and position of the MDI windows. Therefore, several steps
are necessary in order to complete this modification.

The registry information is located at:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNABase\Parameters\ 
  SNADomain REG_SZ: &lt;subdomain name&gt;

Perform the following steps on each SNA Server participating in the subdomain:

1. Stop all SNA services.

2. Run the Svconfig.exe utility which which is found in &lt;snaroot&gt;\system
  directory.

3. Change the SUBDOMAIN NAME field to the desired one.

4. Apply change and click OK to exit.

5. Restart the SNA services.

Perform the following steps where SNA Manager has previously run:

1. Delete the file SNAEXP.SNAV located in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system
  subdirectory.

NOTE: This file will get recreated when SNA Manager is restarted.

NOTE: For SNA clients that are configured to resolve the location of SNA Servers
via subdomain name, an additional change will be required on the client
workstation to reflect the new subdomain name. If this change is not made, then
clients will not be able to locate a SNA Server and fail to create a sponsor
connection. No chnages are required for clients that are configured to locate a
server by name.
