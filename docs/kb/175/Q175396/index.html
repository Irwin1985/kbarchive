SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how a network adapter is chosen for an outbound Internet
protocol (IP) datagram or stream of datagrams, and how a local source IP address
is chosen for those datagrams on a multiple-homed computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of the method that is used to determine this behavior, multiple-homed
computers may send packets through one network adapter but use the source IP
address of another network adapter in the computer. Some hardware or software
firewall products may identify these packets as "spoofed," and therefore
generate an IP spoofing error.

This article applies specifically to programs that use the Windows Sockets
interface to the TCP/IP stack.

For additional information about how an outbound network adapter is chosen for
programs that use NetBIOS over TCP/IP (such as file and print sharing), click

  Q166159 NetBIOS Connections from Multi-homed Computer

The TCP/IP component of all Microsoft Windows operating systems is modeled on a
"Weak End System" or a "Weak E/S" model. This model gives program developers the
greatest amount of leeway when they design programs that use the network and are
compatible with Microsoft products. This model also puts the responsibility of
the behavior of the networking program on the developers, because the developers
specify how the program accesses the TCP/IP stack and responds to incoming and
outgoing frames.

When a Windows Sockets program binds to a socket, one of the parameters that is
passed in the bind() call is the local (source) IP address that should be used
for outbound packets. Most programs do not have any knowledge of network
topology, so they specify IPADDR_ANY instead of a specific IP address in their
bind() call. IPADDR_ANY tells the stack that the program is going to let the
stack choose the best local IP address to use; the program does not specify the
local IP address.

On a computer that has one network adapter, the IP address that is chosen is the
IP address of the network adaptor in the computer. However, on a multiple-homed
computer, the stack must make a choice. The stack cannot make an intelligent
choice until it knows the target IP address for a Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) connection or a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagram.

When the program sends a connect() call to a target IP address, or sends a send()
call to a UDP datagram, the stack references the target IP address, and then
examines the IP route table so that it can choose the best network adapter over
which to send the packet. After this network adapter has been chosen, the stack
reads the source IP address associated with that network adapter and uses that
IP address as the source IP address for the outbound packets.

If the program specifies a source IP address to use in the bind() call, that IP
address is used as the source IP address for TCP connections or UDP datagrams
sourced from that socket. However, the route table is still used to route the
outbound IP datagrams, based on the target IP address. As a result of this
behavior, the source IP address may not be the one associated with the network
adapter that is chosen to send the packets.
