SUMMARY
=======

This sample illustrates how to pass a socket connection between threads in an
MFC application. The sample consists of two projects, the Server and the Client.
The server creates a new thread for each connection to communicate with the
client.

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server
------

The server illustrates using sockets in multiple threads in an MFC application.
The server listens for connections. When a new connection is requested, the
server accepts the connection and then creates the thread to handle the
connection. When the server receives a message, it reverses the message and
sends it back to the client.

In MFC when you have a new connection it is necessary to accept the connection in
the thread that the listening socket is in. The Accept call requires that you
pass in a CAsyncSocket object. MFC then sets up everything correctly so that the
connection can be handle in the thread. If you want to handle this connection in
a different thread, just passing the MFC object to the thread will not work
correctly. To correctly set up everything for the connection to be handled in a
different thread, the following steps are required:

1. Detach the socket handle from the CAsyncSocket object in the thread where the
  connection was accepted.

2. Pass the socket handle to the thread.

3. In the thread, attach this handle to a CAsyncSocket derived object.

The Attach call in the thread sets up everything correctly for the socket
notifications to be sent to the thread you want to handle the connection.

The following code from the Server project illustrates this:

OnAccept for the listening socket.

     void CListensoc::OnAccept(int nErrorCode)
     {
        // New connection is being established

        CSocket soc;

        // Accept the connection using a temp CSocket object.
        Accept(soc);

        // Create a thread to handle the connection.
        // The thread is created suspended so that we can
        // set variables in CConnectThread before it starts executing.
        CConnectThread* pThread =
           (CConnectThread*)AfxBeginThread(
              RUNTIME_CLASS(CConnectThread),
              THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL,
              0,
              CREATE_SUSPENDED);
     ...
        // Pass the socket to the thread by passing the socket handle.
        // You cannot pass a CSocket object across threads.
        pThread-&gt;m_hSocket = soc.Detach();

        // Now start the thread.
        pThread-&gt;ResumeThread();

        CAsyncSocket::OnAccept(nErrorCode);
     }

InitInstance of the thread.

     BOOL CConnectThread::InitInstance()
     {
     ...
        // Attach the socket handle to a CSocket object.
        // This makes sure that the socket notifications are sent
        // to this thread.
        m_socket.Attach(m_hSocket);
     ...
     }

The above code makes sure that the socket is set up correctly in the secondary
thread.

Client
------

The client accepts a host name to connect to. Once the connection is made, the
client allows you to send messages to the server. The client then displays the
message returned from the server.

The server listens on port 9000. The client tries to connect to this port on the
specified host.

The projects were created with Visual C++ version 5.0. However the code in the
samples should apply to the versions of MFC mentioned above.
