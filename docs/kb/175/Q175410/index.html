-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Internet Mail Service (IMS) and the
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Internet Mail Connector (IMC) may stop
periodically when dialing an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

The dial-up schedule is specified in the Dial-up Connections property page in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many ISP's require some sort of user input after the initial modem connection
has been established. Typically this is to select the service type (for example,
PPP) and to enter the user account details, in other words, the username and
password. Because this input needs to be automated for the IMS or IMC to connect
and send or receive mail, a 'post-connect' script is used. This script is
usually supplied by the ISP, but it is also possible for you to write your own.
Please refer to the script.doc in the \winnt\system32\ras directory on your
Windows NT Server for further information on writing these scripts.

Occasionally, the ISP may not respond to the 'post-connect' script and eventually
the IMS or IMC will disconnect from the ISP leaving the script processor
running. This causes the Remote Access Service (RAS) port to remain locked open,
preventing any further connections. The IMS or IMC will appear to not make any
further attempts to dial the ISP. Stopping and starting the IMS or IMC will
cause the following event to be logged in the Windows NT Application Log on each
attempt to dial the ISP:

  Event ID: 4106
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Category: SMTP Interface Events

  The dial-up connection 'OzEmail' could not be made. The error reported
  was: [633] The port is already in use or is not configured for Remote
  Access dial out.

Rebooting the Windows NT Server will free the locked RAS port.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this situation, a script will need to be written or modified that has
specific timeout parameters for each 'waitfor' command. The success of each
'waitfor' command should also be tested before the script proceeds to the next
command. If the situation arises where the ISP does not respond to the script,
the script will stop processing after the timeout has been reached and when the
IMS or IMC disconnects, the RAS port will not remain locked thus allowing the
IMS or IMC to redial as scheduled.

Here is a sample script with the additional timeout logic added. Please note that
this script is specific to the OzEmail ISP in Australia and may not work with
any other ISP. Please contact your ISP for further information as to the script
requirements.
