-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To accept logons from Internet clients, the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
must be configured to accept the authentication method supported by the client.
This article addresses how to enable the Exchange Server to accept Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) authentication.

Check your client's documentation to determine what authentication methods it
supports and how to configure the client to use authentication.

See the "More Information" section for an overview of SSL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are running Exchange 5.5 on a Windows 2000 server, the Key Manger is not
integrated into the IIS Admin program. You must run Key Manager by using the
executable file Keyring.exe.

To start the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) Key Manager in Windows
2000, click Start, click Run, type "keyring.exe" (without the quotation marks)
in the Open box, and then click OK.

To enable Exchange Server to accept SSL authentication:

1. Make sure that Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 is installed and that Service
  Pack 3 is applied.

2. Install Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 3.0 or later
  before you install Exchange Server. This step is critical. If IIS is not
  installed before Exchange Server, the protocols supported by Exchange Server
  are not available in the IIS Key Manager.

3. Install Exchange Server version 5.0 or later. Select the Authentication
  settings for each protocol for which you want to install certificates.

  a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, expand the Configuration
     container, and then click the Protocols object.

  b. Select the appropriate protocol (for example, POP3, NNTP, LDAP) by
     double-clicking its associated icon.

  c. In the protocol's property pages, click the Authentication tab, and then
     set the authentication levels.

  d. Click OK to save the settings.

4. Using the IIS Key Manager, create a key request.

  a. Start the Key Manager included with Internet Information Server.

  b. Locate the Exchange Server icon, and click the appropriate protocol (for
     example, POP3, NNTP, LDAP).

  c. On the menu, click Key, and then click Create New Key.

  d. Type the appropriate information in the fields. Click OK to save the
     information to a request file.

     NOTE: If you are on Windows 2000 and you are prompted to automatically
     submit the request to the on-line authority, this will fail. Continue to
     save the information to a file and then submit the request to the Windows
     2000 (CA) Certificate Authority through the Certificate Authority's web
     site interface http://MachineName/certsrv. If you use a Windows 2000
     Enterprise CA you will be prompted for which template to use. You need to
     use the Web Server template. A stand-alone root CA will not prompt you.
     Download the certificate from the CA in base64 encoding, not DER encoding.

  e. Send the key request to a certificate distribution company (such as
     Verisign) to obtain a certificate for the server.

5. Using the IIS Key Manager, install the SSL certificate.

  a. After you obtain the certificate, start the Key Manager included with
     Internet Information Server.

  b. Locate the Exchange Server icon, and then click the appropriate protocol
     (for example, POP3, NNTP, LDAP).

  c. On the menu, click Key, and then click Install Key Certificate.

  d. Select the certificate file sent by the certificate vendor. If your are
     running IIS 4.0, you must specify the server IP address or specify to bind
     the certificate to "Default."

  e. On the menu, click Servers, and click Commit Changes Now.

The SSL authentication method uses public/private key technology to ensure
privacy. The SSL protocol resides at the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
presentation layer and moves data from the application layer to the TCP
transport layer. It is responsible for authentication, encryption, and
verification of data integrity.

The authentication function assures that the data is being sent to the correct
server and that the server is secure. Encryption ensures that data cannot be
read by anyone other than the target server. Data integrity ensures that the
data has not been corrupted or altered in transit.

Client Obtains Server Certificate
---------------------------------

The client and server introduce themselves to each other with HELO/EHLO messages
(for SMTP/ESMTP respectively) and exchange information containing the encryption
method to use, session information, server certificate (containing the server's
public key), and random data.

Client Verifies Server
----------------------

The client verifies that the server certificate is from a certifying authority
and then uses it to send a message to authenticate the server (to verify it is
who it claims to be). If the server does not pass the authentication, the client
typically informs the user that the server is not who it claims to be.

Client/Server Determine Encryption Key to Use for This Session
--------------------------------------------------------------

If the server replies back successfully, the client and server create a random
secret key (referred to as the Master Key in the SSL specification) from the
random data exchanged and the encryption method specified (such as RSA).

Data Encrypted with Agreed Upon Key
-----------------------------------

All data sent over the SSL channel is encrypted with the secret key.
