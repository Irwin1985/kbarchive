SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to configure a Microsoft Exchange View Only Administrator (VOA)
at the Microsoft Exchange Site level for accounts that you want to be able to
view the configuration of a Microsoft Exchange Server, but not be able to modify
it. This article discusses the complications in configuring VOAs that arise due
to fact that the Microsoft Mail Connector does not store most of its
configuration in the Microsoft Exchange Directory, like other Microsoft Exchange
Server objects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the VOA is also a Windows NT Domain Administrator, they will also be able to
modify the Microsoft Mail Connector properties. This is because the Microsoft
Mail Connector does not read the permissions set in the Microsoft Exchange
Directory like other Microsoft Exchange Server objects. The Microsoft Mail
Connector stores most of its configuration information in the Windows NT
Registry and in the Microsoft Mail Connector Postoffice.

Upon opening the Microsoft Mail Connector properties, the Windows NT Service
Control Manager (SCM) permissions are checked. If there is administrator access
to the SCM, the Microsoft Mail Connector properties page is opened with full
read-write access. If there is read-only access to the SCM, the Microsoft Mail
Connector is opened in read-only mode and changes to the configuration are not
possible.

Because read-only or read-write access to the Microsoft Mail Connector properties
page is determined by the Windows NT level of access to the SCM, the following
four cases exist. Relevant workarounds are detailed as appropriate and can be
implemented to bring the Microsoft Mail Connector access in line with that of
the Microsoft Exchange Server Site permissions.

- CASE 1: Windows NT Administrator and Microsoft Exchange View Only
  Administrator

  Assign read-only access to the Microsoft Exchange Connector Postoffice share
  (\\exchsrvr\maildat$) for all VOAs. This simulates another account already
  administering the Microsoft Mail Connector because the Flag.glb file cannot
  be locked for write access. The Microsoft Mail Connector's properties page
  will be opened in read-only mode. When this happens, the following dialog
  will be displayed:

  An instance of the Administrator program is already running
  against the MS Mail Connector. You can view the configuration
  information, but you cannot edit it.

  Alternatively, the VOA can have it's Windows NT Administrator access
  restricted to Windows NT User access.

- CASE 2: Windows NT Administrator and Microsoft Exchange Administrator

  The behaviour here is as expected and no alterations are needed.

- CASE 3: Windows NT User and Microsoft Exchange View Only Administrator

  The behaviour here is as expected and no alterations are required.

- CASE 4: Windows NT User and Microsoft Exchange Administrator

  In this case, the Microsoft Exchange Administrator will not be able to
  administer the Microsoft Mail Connector properties because they will not have
  the appropriate SCM access. Full Windows NT Administrator permissions will be
  needed if this account is to be able to administer the Microsoft Mail
  Connector properties.
