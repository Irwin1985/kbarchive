- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Report Designer to print a general field that has text inserted
into it with a word processor, the OLE bound Control object of the Report
Designer has to be sized to be as large as the largest amount of text in the
general fields. This can present problems if there are multiple pages of text in
the general field. The OLE Bound control can be enlarged only to the height of a
single page in the Report Designer, which is usually not large enough to print a
general field that has more than a page of data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using a memo field would be one way to store the data and have it print
correctly in the Report Designer. The problem with this method is that any
formatting such as underlining, bolding, or different font sizes of the text is
not allowed in a memo field. A word processor is needed to format data in this
way and storing it into a general field is the only way to keep the formatting
of the data intact. Instead of using the Report Designer to print the general
field, sending it to a word processor like Word for Windows will allow all of
the data in a general field to be printed correctly.

Below are two examples of code that use OLE Automation to call Word and then use
WordBasic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) commands to pass the data to
Word. The first example works only with Word 6.0 or Word 95 with any version of
Visual FoxPro. The second example works only with Word 97 and Visual FoxPro
versions 5.0 with Service Pack 2 and 6.0. If the error "OLE error code
0x80020005: Type Mismatch." occurs, then look at the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q169565 Type Mismatch Using OLE Automation to Word 97

If using the example that works with Word 6.0 or Word 95 and the following error
occurs, then the data in the general field of the table was inserted with Word
97:

  OLE Idispatch exception code 269 from Microsoft Word: Microsoft Word Err=1269
  - Word cannot edit the object...

Change to the second example using Visual FoxPro 5.0 SP 2 and Word 97 to pass the
data to Word.

To use the code as is, you need to create a table with field names like those
below:

  Field Name      Type                    Width
  ----------      ---------               -----
  FIRST           Character                15
  LAST            Character                15
  ADDRESS         Character                25
  CITY            Character                15
  STATE           Character                 2
  ZIPCODE         Character                 5
  GEN             General                   4

After building the table and adding some data to each character field, make sure
that each general field has been populated by double-clicking on the general
field to open it and selecting the EDIT - INSERT OBJECT menu options. With the
"Create New" button selected, select "Microsoft Word Document" in the "Object
Type" list box and type some data into Word. Close Word to save the data into
the general field.

The following code works with Visual FoxPro 3.x, 5.x, and 6.0 when using Word 6.0
or Word 95. Place the following code into a program (.prg) file and run it.

     ************* Beginning of code. ****************

     PUBLIC oWord
      oWord = CREATEOBJECT("Word.Basic")
      WITH oWord
         .AppShow        &amp;&amp; Makes Word Visible
         .FileNewDefault &amp;&amp; Opens up blank Word document

         * The following Insert commands place the FoxPro fields into
         * the Word document. You can change these commands to place
         * any text in the document.
         * Ensure that the table is already open. If only a portion
         * of records are to be printed, change the EOF() to a certain
         * number so that all of the records do not get processed.
         * Example: DO WHILE RECNO() &lt; 10

         GO TOP

         DO WHILE NOT EOF()
            .Insert("Record: "+ALLTRIM(STR(RECNO())))
              &amp;&amp; The above line shows the record number.
            .InsertPara
            .InsertPara
            .Insert(ALLTRIM(first)+" "+last)   &amp;&amp; Field in the table.
            .InsertPara
            .Insert(address)
            .InsertPara
            .Insert(ALLTRIM(city)+", "+state+"  "+zipcode)
            .InsertPara
            .InsertPara
            .Insert("Contents of the General Field:")
            .InsertPara
            .InsertPara
             KEYBOARD "{ctrl+c} {ctrl+w}" &amp;&amp; Copies and closes the general
                                          &amp;&amp; field to the clipboard.
             MODIFY GENERAL gen           &amp;&amp; This has to be after the
                                          &amp;&amp; KEYBOARD command.
            .EditPaste
            .WordLeft(1,1)
            .EditObject("0")
            .EditSelectAll
            .Editcopy
            .FileClose
            .EditClear
            .EditPaste
            .InsertPara
            .InsertPara
            .InsertPara
             SKIP                     &amp;&amp; Move the record pointer to
                                      &amp;&amp; the next record.
         ENDDO
         .FileSaveAs("c:\mydoc.doc")  &amp;&amp; Saves the Word document as
                                      &amp;&amp; Mydoc.doc.
         .FilePrint
      ENDWITH
     .AppClose

  **************** End of code. ****************

If you are using Word 97, Visual FoxPro 5.0 Service Pack 2 and Visual FoxPro 6.0
are the only versions that run this code correctly. Place the following code

        * the Word document. You can change these commands to place
