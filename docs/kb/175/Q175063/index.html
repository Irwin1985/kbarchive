SUMMARY
=======

Host Security Integration contains three installable components which are not
installed by default when installing SNA Server. They include:

- SNA Host Account Synchronization Service: SNAHOSTPROCESS

- Windows NT Password Synchronization Service: SNAPMP

- Host Account Cache Service: SNADATABASE

All three components work together providing features such as Account Mapping,
Password Synchronization, and Automatic Logon which is also referred to as
Single Sign-On (SSO) support. The implementation of your Windows NT Domains
determines where each component (service) resides. Certain components must be
installed on certain systems as indicated below. Microsoft recommends that all
three components be installed regardless of if you don't plan on using a
particular component, due to the way these services register themselves with the
other components. It is also recommended that all services are installed in the
same user security administrator's account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNAHOSTPROCESS

The SNA Host Account Synchronization Service, also known as SNAHOSTPROCESS, is
responsible for automatic password synchronization and security between Windows
NT and IBM host or AS/400 systems. Although this service is not dependent on the
SNA protocol, it is recommended that this service be installed on SNA Server
computers. SNAHOSTPROCESS is installed if the Host Security Integration option
is selected while installing SNA Server.

SNAHOSTPROCESS is responsible for propagating password changes to the host and
for receiving password changes from it. When a Windows NT password changes,
SNAPMP coordinates with SNAHOSTPROCESS to apply these changes to the Host.
Similarly, password changes received from the Host by SNAHOSTPROCESS are
forwarded to SNAPMP for appropriate distribution. The SEC400.DLL included with
SNA Server 3.0 applies Windows NT password changes to AS/400 systems running
OS/400 V3R1 or later. For password changes coming from an AS/400, Host Code is
required from a third-party vendor such as ExecuSoft, Inc. The SNAHOSTPROCESS
also supports RACF V2R2, Computer Associates International CA-Top Secret (MVS,
VM, VSE) and ACF2 (MVS) Security systems on IBM Mainframes. The Security
Integration DLLs and Host Code for those security systems are available from
Proginet Inc. Proginet supports automatic password synchronization using LU6.2
protocol to communicate with IBM Mainframe systems. See the Companion Products
Catalog on the SNA Server CD for additional references.


SNAPMP

The Windows NT Password Synchronization Service is responsible for synchronizing
passwords between a host and the Windows NT domain. It then coordinates all
updates to the Host Account Cache (SNADATABASE). The Snapwchg.dll is responsible
for intercepting password changes made to Windows NT accounts in its Windows NT
Domain and passing them on to SNAPMP. The Master Windows NT Password
Synchronization Service must be installed on the primary domain controller of
the Windows NT domain in which the user accounts are defined. At any given time
there should be only 1 Master PMP in the whole Host Security Setup (across
multiple domains).

The Windows NT Password Synchronization Service is installed using the Setup
program located in the \HOSTSEC directory on the SNA Server CD.


SNADATABASE

The Host Account Cache implements a database of host accounts associated with
Windows NT Domain Accounts. The SNADATABASE receives updates from SNAPMP by
using RPC calls which are then sent to any backup SNADATABASE's that are running
in the Host Security Domain.

The SNADATABASE service must be installed on a Primary Domain Controller and a
Backup Role can be chosen which would be installed on Windows NT Backup Domain
Controllers that belong to the same SNA Server Windows NT Domain.

The SNAPMP and SNADATABASE components must be installed on computers running
Windows NT Domain Controllers, but unlike Security Integration Service
(SNAHOSTPROCESS), these components can be installed on computers not running SNA
Server. For this reason, these components are installed using a separate setup
program located in the HOSTSEC folder of each Windows NT platform on the SNA
Server CD.


Creating a Host Security Domain (HSD)

After all three services are installed; a Host Security Domain must be
configured. Although this process can be completed by using the Insert menu in
Manager, using the Host Security Domain Wizard from the Tools menu is a much
simpler process, since multiple configuration steps are performed automatically.
Using the Host Security Domain Wizard:

1. Provide a name for the host security domain.

  For simplicity, the name should reflect the name of the remote system where
  the user accounts reside. For example, if the AS/400 name is "RAINIER", use
  the name "RAINIER". If the remote system is a RACF on host system MVS1, then
  use the name "MVS1RACF".

  Using the wizard, the name given during this process creates a Local Group in
  the Windows NT Domain, which by default will contain the Domain Users global
  group. The Domain Users group must be added in order for users to participate
  in a Security Domain.

2. Provide the connection name and account mapping method to be used.

  Enter the connection name that will be used for this Host Security Domain,
  followed by the "User Name Mapping". Enable automatic password
  synchronization is the next option that can be selected. Automatic password
  synchronization requires a Security Integration DLL which must be chosen from
  the drop down box.

3. Choose the Local and Remote APPC LU's to use on this connection.

  You will then go on to select your Local and Remote APPC LU pairings used for
  this defined connection.

4. Configure users in the host account cache.

  The last and final step of this process is to configure the Host Account
  Cache. This is done by going into the Tools menu in SNA Server Manager and
  selecting Host Account Manager. The Host Account Configuration dialog is
  displayed and you can then configure your users appropriately. You must first
  select a User Account from the Windows NT Database. Select Use Windows NT
  User Name or Use This User ID. Use Windows NT Password or Use This Password
  also must be selected.

Single-Signon Support

Sample operation of single-signon with an APPC or CPIC application:

- APPC application calls [MC_]ALLOCATE and requests security=AP_PGM or AP_SAME,
  and sets the user_id=MS$SAME, and pwd=MS$SAME. The SNA Server APPC DLL then
  forwards the Allocate request to SNA Server.

- If a CPIC application is used, the conversation security, userid and password
  fields must be set using the Set_Conversation_Security_Type (cmscst, setting
  conversation_security_type = CM_SECURITY_PROGRAM or CM_SECURITY_SAME),
  Set_Conversation_Security_Password (cmscsp, setting security_password =
  MS$SAME), and Set_Conversation_Security_User_ID (cmscsu, setting
  security_user_ID = MS$SAME), before calling Allocate_Conversation (cmallc).

- The SNA Server checks if the Windows NT user making this request is a member
  of the host security domain. If so, the host security account information is
  looked up for the user and replaced in the userid and password fields in the
  FMH-5 Attach message, and then is sent to the remote system.

Sample operation of single-signon with a 3270 application (supported with SNA 3.0
SP1 and later):

- First, the 3270 emulator must support "scripting" of user input.

- The user or administrator must record a script for the user, capturing the
  host logon process. At the host logon screen, the user or administrator must
  enter the following values for the host user id = MS$SAMEU and password =
  MS$SAMEP.

- When the 3270 emulator starts up (configured to automaticaly run the scripted
  logon), the above MS$SAMEU and MS$SAMEP is passed to the SNA Server.

- The SNA Server checks if the Windows NT user making this request is a member
  of the host security domain. If so, the host security account information is
  looked up for the user and replaced in the userid and password fields in the
  host signon screen, and then is sent to the remote system.
