SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses information on how to configure a Routing and Remote
Access Service (RRAS) LAN-to-LAN Routing Dial-on-Demand (DOD) connection over
Nwlink.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure a RRAS LAN-to-LAN Routing DOD connection over Nwlink, start the
RRAS Administration utility, and then perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the LAN and Demand Dial Interfaces key, and click Add Interface.

  a. The name to be typed MUST be the name of a valid user account on the
     Dial-up RRAS server, and then click Next.

  b. Select "Route IPX packets on this interface" only, and then click Next.

  c. Type the telephone number of the Dial-up server, and then click Next.

  d. Type the user name, domain, and password of a valid user account on the
     Dial-up server, and then click Finish.

  e. Select Enable IPX on this Interface and make sure that both locations are
     set to use the same Dial In Control Protocol, then click OK.

  f. Make sure that Accept Broadcasts are enabled. If Always is selected, a
     Demand-Dial connection will be established whenever a Windows NT- based
     router receives a NetBIOS over IPX broadcast. If Statically Seeded is
     selected, only broadcast packets that are defined for a statically
     configured NetBIOS name, configured under the Static NetBIOS Names key,
     will be propagated. If only When Interface is Up is Selected it will act
     as if it was configured for Always, but only when the DOD connection is
     active. Click OK.

  g. Make sure that the Update Mode for RIP for IPX is set to Auto- Static,
     then click OK.

  h. Make sure that the Update Mode for SAP for IPX is set to Auto- Static,
     then click OK.

2. Select the NetBIOS Broadcasts key, and make sure that both the Internal and
  External network interface cards (NICs) are configured to Accept and Deliver
  NetBIOS Broadcasts. If either NIC is not configured to Accept and Deliver
  NetBIOS broadcasts, then right-click the NetBIOS Boradcasts key, and then
  click Configure Interface.

3. Each interface should be set to Accept Broadcasts and Deliver Broadcasts and
  be set to Always for full LAN-to-LAN connectivity.

4. Select the RIP for IPX key, and make sure that both the Internal and External
  NICs are configured to perform in a Standard update mode. If either NIC is
  not configured in this manner, right-click the RIP for IPX key, and then
  click Configure Interface.

5. Configure each interface to perform in a Standard update mode.

6. Select the SAP for IPX key and make sure that both the Internal and External
  NICs are configured to perform in a Standard update mode If either NIC is not
  configured in this manner, right-click the SAP for IPX key, and then click
  Configure Interface.

7. Make sure that the Update Mode for both the Internal and External NIC is set
  to Standard.

8. Right-click the Static NetBIOS Names key if you are using a Statically Seeded
  delivery method for NetBIOS Resolution, and click Add NetBIOS Name.

9. Type the NetBIOS name of the remote computer that you wish to connect to.
  Leave the Type field blank so it will propagate all computer types associated
  with the name. Click the DOD connection that will be used to communicate with
  the other RRAS router.

10. After the steps above have been performed on both RRAS servers, select the
  IPX Routing Summary key, and click the DOD connection that will be used to
  communicate with the other RRAS router. Right-click the IPX Routing Summary
  key, and then click Connect.

11. After you've connected, select IPX Routing Summary key, and then the DOD
  connection that will be used to communicate with the other Steelhead router.

12. Right-click the IPX Routing Summary key, and then click Update Routes.

At this point, Nwlink LAN-to-LAN routing should be successfully installed, and
full network connectivity is available.
