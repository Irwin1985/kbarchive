SUMMARY
=======

This article lists answers to frequently asked questions about using Microsoft
Chat version 2.0 on MSN, The Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is Microsoft Chat 2.0?

  A. Microsoft Chat 2.0 is the only Internet chat program that gives you the
  option of conversing inside a comic strip. When you use a standard chat
  program, you enter a chat room on an Internet server and conduct real-time
  conversations with other people. However, when you use Chat 2.0, you may also
  pick a cartoon character to represent you. Your conversation appears as word
  balloons inside the frames of a comic strip. As a cartoon character, you may
  express a wide range of emotions, send "thoughts," whisper to a selected
  recipient, and save the chat session for off-line viewing.

  The Chat 2.0 window is composed of the following parts:
   - A viewing pane where the conversation is displayed.

   - A member list pane that lists all the members in a chat room.

   - A compose pane (a text box at the bottom of the window) where you type
     your messages.

   - Buttons you may click to send messages.

  When you use the Comic Chat option of Chat 2.0, you see the following:
   - A "starring" pane that displays the title of the chat and lists the
     participants.

   - A self-view pane that shows what your character looks like.

   - An emotion wheel that enables you to control all of your character's
     emotions.

2. Q. What are the differences between Comic Chat 1.x and Chat 2.0?

  A. Although Comic Chat 1.x and Chat 2.0 are very similar, Chat 2.0 has some
  significant enhancements and features, including:
   - Better support for text chat.

   - Customizable fonts in both text and comic (voice balloon) areas.

   - A toolbar with one-click access to tools and resources, as well as easy
     execution of common tasks.

   - A user list that allows you to search for users in all rooms on a chat
     server.

   - Macros that let you have a favorite reply instantly ready.

   - Sounds that you can send to embellish your conversation, from small noises
     to music.

   - Enhanced whisper capabilities that let you whisper to people in other
     rooms.

     To determine if you are using Comic Chat 1.x or Chat 2.0, look at the top
     of the window that appears while you are running the chat. Either Comic
     Chat or Microsoft Chat is displayed on the title bar.
