SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete an Organizational Forms library (OFL) from a site that has more
than two individual Forms libraries of the same language may cause the wrong
form to be deleted. Specifically, this occurs in the following situation. Two
sites, A and B, have an English OFL called A and B, respectively. An
administrator in site A pulls a replica of the site B OFL so that site A now has
a replica of both A and B OFLs. The administrator opens the Forms Administrator
and can see both OFLs. If the administrator deletes OFL B, it disappears from
view in the Forms Administrator, but re-appears in Forms Administrator upon
exit. OFL A, however, will have been deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

When deleting an OFL, follow the following steps:

1. Ensure that the site has only a single replica, the replica that exists in
  the OFL's home site.

  The end result prior to deletion would be as follows:

   - There are no replicas of OFL A anywhere in site B.

   - There are no replicas of OFL B anywhere in site A.

2. Verify that OFL B was not replicated to other sites. The only replica of OFL
  B should exist in site B on OFL B's home server.

3. Delete the OFL from the Forms Administrator while connected to the server
  that maintains the single replica. In the example above, this would mean
  connecting to a server in site B.

4. Open the Forms Administrator, and delete OFL B.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.0.
