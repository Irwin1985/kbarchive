-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a network resource on the domain, you may receive the
following error message:

  \\&lt;servername&gt; is not accessible

  The user must change his password before he logs on the first time.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions exist:

- An administrator has enabled "User must change password at next logon" option
  in your user account properties on the domain controller while you are logged
  on to the domain.

- The session between your computer and the domain controller has terminated.
  This can occur if your session has been inactive for a long period of time
  causing the protocol's timeout period to expire.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, log off your computer, log back on, and then change your
password.

To prevent this issue from occurring, the administrator should be certain that
the user is logged off before setting the policy that requires the user to
change the password at the next logon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5, 3.51 and
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are inactive on the network for the protocol's timeout period causing the
session between your computer and the domain controller to be terminated, and
then you attempt to access a network resource on the domain, you must be
authenticated by the domain controller again. When this occurs, Windows NT does
not differentiate between a network connection and a network logon. If the "User
must change password at next logon" option has been enabled, you cannot to
connect to the network resource until you log off, log back on, and then change
your password.
