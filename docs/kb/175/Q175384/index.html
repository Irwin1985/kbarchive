- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a TN3270 client is connecting through the SNA Server TN3270 Service, on
certain host screens, the TN3270 client keyboard remains locked in an XCLOCK
state. A native 3270 client does not have this problem.

This problem occurs with the TN3270 Service included with Microsoft SNA Server
version 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2).

CAUSE
=====

The client keyboard lock occurs when the host application sends a 3270 message
to the client and indicates an End Bracket (EB), but the WCC field in the 3270
message does not unlock the keyboard. (That is, bit 6 in the WCC field is set to
"0" which means that the keyboard is locked.) Because a TN3270 client never
receives the SNA Request/Response Header (RH), it is not aware of the EB
indicator and does not determine that the keyboard should be unlocked. Because
the host application does not unlock the keyboard properly in the WCC byte, the
TN3270 emulator's keyboard remains locked.

This problem does not occur with a native 3270 emulator because it receives the
SNA RH, and unlocks the keyboard when it receives an EB, even if the 3270 WCC
field does not unlock the keyboard.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to the SNA Server TN3270 Service is available from Microsoft to
correct this problem. With the update TN3servr.exe file applied, the TN3270
server monitors for the EB indicator on host messages, and if it is set, will
automatically set the WCC Bit 6 (keyboard state) to 1 to notify the TN3270
client that the keyboard should be unlocked.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround available for this problem is to modify the host application
so that it properly sets the WCC bit 6 to unlock the keyboard on host screens
which exhibit the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0, 3.0 SP1, and 3.0
Service Pack 2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
