SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the adjustment of some of the security settings in the
source code that is provided for the sample programs in the Microsoft Platform
Software Development Kit (SDK).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the sample programs in the Systems Management Server (SMS) portion
of the Microsoft Platform SDK, you may have to adjust some of the security
settings that are implemented in the source code that is provided for the sample
programs.

The source code is provided for each sample to demonstrate basic functionality
and to provide an example of how a particular task can be accomplished by means
of a program.

NOTE: Microsoft provides script, macro, and other code examples for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not limited to
the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This script is provided "as is" and Microsoft does not guarantee that
the script, macro, or code can be used in all situations.

If the Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual Basic
Scripting Edition samples are used directly from previous versions, and they are
run from a Windows NT 4.0-based computer, your computer may experience
unpredictable behavior. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that you enable
the distributed version of Component Object Model (DCOM) impersonation level of
"Impersonate". For more details, refer to the following Microsoft Developer
Network Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com

SMS, and the SMS Windows Management Instrumentation SMS Providers enforce a
strong security model. Because of this requirement, the SMS Provider uses the
Impersonation method.

For example, when you compile the Visual C++ sample source code, you must ensure
that you specify "Impersonation" in your "CoInitializeSecurity" call:

  return CoInitializeSecurity (NULL, -1, NULL, NULL, 
          bAuthenticate ? RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT : RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE, 
          RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE, NULL, EOAC_NONE, 0);

Then, you must recompile the program to update the executable files.

In your Visual Basic code, you must specify "Impersonation" as demonstrated in
the following example:

  WbemServices.Security_.ImpersonationLevel = wbemImpersonationLevelImpersonate

Then, you must recompile the program to update the executable files.

In Visual Basic Scripting Edition, you must specify "Impersonation" as
demonstrated in the following example:

  winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}

Because VBScripts are not compiled, any changes are effective the next time that
the script is run.

NOTE: The preceding changes have been incorporated into the current release of
the Microsoft Platform SDK, which is available at the following Microsoft File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/
