-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an ISAPI DLL has the same name as a DLL that is listed in the
InProcessIsapiApps metabase entry, Internet Information Services (IIS) loads the
ISAPI extension in-process even when the Application is marked for High
Isolation.

CAUSE
=====

When IIS reads the list of InProcessIsapiApps from the metabase, it makes two
copies of each entry: one copy of the entire path and one copy of only the DLL.
This allows for relative path matching.

==========
