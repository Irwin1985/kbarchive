SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate from GroupWise 5.5.x to Exchange Server, you may not be able to
transfer GroupWise mail messages from the Novell server to Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 4 (SP4) using the migration tool. When you try to export to .pst
files, one or more of the following events may be logged in the Microsoft Event
Viewer application log:

  Event ID 8072
  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMig
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 8072
  Description: Directory Section C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\GrpWise.005\Directory.PRI Line:
  5 Unexpected MAPI error.

  -or-

  Event ID 8074
  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMig
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 8074
  Description: MAPI Section C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\GrpWise.005\00000001.PRI Line: 2
  Failed to connect to the Mailbox. GWise:Harbour.STL.BOB

  Event ID 8124
  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMig
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 8124
  Description: Parser Error C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\GrpWise.005\00000001.PRI Line: 4 Bad
  section encountered. The remainder of this section will be skipped.

  -or-

  Event ID 8002
  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMig
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 8002 Description: Errors occurred during the Migration Process. A
  recovery file has been created called C:\TEMP\00000002.PRI.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the migrated user exists on the Exchange Server computer
as a user or custom recipient. Confirm that the administrator has manually
created a user in Exchange Server with the same name as the migrated user.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the users were created manually on Exchange Server, delete one of the
mailboxes that was created manually and the Microsoft Windows NT account
associated with it. If this procedure does not solve the problem, perform one of
the procedures that is described in the "Workaround" section.

WORKAROUND
==========

Depending on the circumstances, you can use either of the procedures described
in this section.

Scenario One
------------

If all the GroupWise users are going to be migrated at the same time, you can
reply to old GroupWise addresses in the migrated messages. In this case, use the
following procedure:

1. If the account already exists in Exchange Server, add the GroupWise proxy
  address of the GroupWise users mailbox in Exchange Server, so that Exchange
  Server knows where to import the mail.

2. Click to clear the "Information to create mailboxes" check box.

3. If you still are experiencing issues, clear the password in GroupWise,
  otherwise there may be some corruption in Novell Domain Server (NDS).

Scenario Two
------------

If the number of the users staying on GroupWise is large, obtain GroupWise client
version 5.2 to use in the migration. In this scenario, the SMTP messages that
were originally received in the user's GroupWise mailbox after they are migrated
cannot be replied to because the sender's address is incomplete or invalid.
