SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to a Web site that is set to require client certificates, you
may receive the following HTTP error message even if you are sure that the
client certificate has not been revoked:

  403.13 Client Certificate Revoked

CAUSE
=====

By default, Internet Information Services (IIS) checks to see if the client
certificate that is being presented has been revoked. It does this by
downloading the client certificate's Certificate Revocation List (CRL) from a
Certificate Distribution Point (CDP) that is listed as part of the client
certificate. If IIS is unable to download at least one of the CRLs of the client
certificate, the HTTP error message is displayed in the client's browser.

RESOLUTION
==========

For each certificate in the chain that has a CDP listed, ensure that IIS is able
to download at least one CRL. This usually involves adjusting firewall, proxy,
or Domain Name Server (DNS) settings to admit the necessary traffic; depending
on the protocol, this can be Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or remote
procedure call (RPC). Note that the Web server must be able to resolve the CRL
even if the client browser can resolve the CRL because the Web server is
servicing the HTTP request that requires the client certificate.

To avoid the HTTP 403.13 error message, do one of the following:

- Enable IIS to download the CRL. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Delete any duplicate client certificates (that is, client certificates
     that are issued from the same Certificate Authority) from the client
     browser.

  2. Start with the client certificate and proceed up the certification path.
     Paste each certificate's CDP HTTP reference in the browser on the server.
     If the file fails to download, there is a problem with the CDP.

NOTE: Double-click each certificate in the certification path to view its
properties.

  3. Use the PING, Tracert.exe, or Wfetch.exe utilities to identify any name
     resolution or network latency issues that arise when you contact the
     problem CDP.

  4. Find the IP address of the problem CDP and add an entry to the HOSTS file
     on the IIS computer. This should enable IIS to download the CRL and
     resolve the error.

  5. Repeat these steps for each certificate in the client certificate's
     certification path.

- If a proxy computer is involved, change the account that is used to start IIS
  to a domain administrator account and restart the IIS Admin service. If this
  resolves the issue, the local system account, or the account that is
  regularly used to start IIS, does not have sufficient permissions on the
  proxy server to access the Internet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view a certificate's CDP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.

2. On the Content tab, click Certificates.

3. On the Personal tab, double-click the client certificate.

4. Click the Certification Path tab of the client certificate to display each
  certificate in the path.

5. Double-click each of these certificates and click the Details tab. The CRL
  Distribution Point field contains entries that list the path to download the
  associated .crl file.

NOTE: If a CDP is not listed, proceed to the next higher certificate in the
path.
If a CDP extension is present in a certificate that is part of the certification
path, IIS must be able to download at least one of the CRLs. If IIS is unable to
resolve the CRL, it returns the HTTP 403.13 error.

Sample CRL Distribution Points:

[1]CRL Distribution Point
    Distribution Point Name:
         Full Name:
              URL=http://server.domain.com/CertEnroll/server%20Root%20CA.crl&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;

[2]CRL Distribution Point
    Distribution Point Name:
         Full Name:
              URL=file://\\server2.domain.com\CertEnroll\server2%20Root%20CA.crl
